It was time-consuming to identify a vehicle had been stolen and the longer the vehicle went undetected as stolen, the less likely it was to be returned.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Hertz RevLab and Focused Labs embarked on a project called SVU (stolen vehicles unit). The teams built and deployed a mobile application that allows the Hertz recovery team to detect, track and recover stolen vehicles. So far it has been wildly successful.

Uber and Lyft are both technology-forward companies with everything necessary to their business living within an app on the driver and rider\\u2019s phones.

Focused Labs\\u2019 core practices of pair programming, CI/CD, and test-driven development have laid a foundation that future BTR Energy developers can build on in the years to come.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Share\"}\\n{\"p\": \"433 W Van Buren St\\nSuite 1100-B\\nChicago, IL 60607\\n(708) 303-8088\"}\\n{\"p\": \"\\u00a9 2022 Focused Labs, All Rights Reserved.\"}\\n{\"h1\": \"Helping Hertz Leverage Technology to Capture New Markets\"}\\n{\"h1\": \"Helping Hertz Leverage Technology To Capture New Markets\"}\\n{\"h2\": \"Focused on Delivery\"}\\n{\"h2\": \"Focused on Results\"}\\n{\"h2\": \"Focused on Partnership\"}\\n{\"h2\": \"Navigating a culture and technology transformation\"}\\n{\"h2\": \"Building a more durable business with technology solutions\"}\\n{\"h2\": \"Gaining new revenue streams for Hertz with last-mile delivery\"}\\n{\"h2\": \"Changing the future of Hertz technology\"}\\n{\"h2\": \"Contact Us\"}\\n{\"h3\": \"Car Rental\"}\\n{\"h3\": \"3\\n          months\"}\\n{\"h3\": \"5\\n          products\"}\\n{\"h3\": \"SVU: Stolen Vehicles Unit\"}\\n{\"h3\": \"TNC: Transportation Network Company\"}\\n{\"h3\": \"Making tens of thousands of software-enabled deliveries within retail shipping\"}\\n{\"h3\": \"Increased revenue captured via logistics\"}\\n{\"h3\": \"Get in touch with us\"}\\n{\"h3\": \"\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Case study\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Industry\"}\\n{\"p\": \"recovered thousands of stolen vehicles with a new mobile app\"}\\n{\"p\": \"#Increase in Revenue\"}\\n{\"p\": \"delivered with quick turnaround times in 11 months\"}\\n{\"p\": \"#Fast and Functional\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Built and deployed multiple applications with quick turnaround times.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Focused Labs teams saved Hertz thousands of dollars.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Focused Labs showed the developers at Hertz that technology solutions can be fast, functional, and profitable.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Focused on Delivery: Built and deployed mobile application that allows the Hertz recovery team to detect, track and recover stolen vehicles.

Focused Labs took a very enablement-centric approach during the development process. Although Hertz had a very capable engineering team, they relied on Focused Labs to bring new, impactful, and sustainable engineering practices into their organization.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Diversifying lines of business is one of the best ways to leverage technology within a company. More and more, technology and outside forces are shaping industries in new, quick ways that can make age-old businesses feel like they are in a constant state of flux. For instance, car rental giant Hertz and similar companies were upended as the pandemic shut down almost all global travel and put the need to rent cars at a standstill. Technology has helped Hertz rebound and opens up new lines of business while also finding solutions to old problems. But they didn\\u2019t always have the technology infrastructure to respond proactively to these issues.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Hertz hired Opal Perry as Global CIO \\u2014 to rebuild a technology-forward culture that would see digital solutions as a way to grow new business and not just a functional necessity.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"In the past, Hertz had outsourced a lot of its technology needs to external vendors. While it was functional for the ways technology had previously served Hertz, using outside vendors left their technology arm with a lack of innovation. An agile technology team within a business can know the pain points and work to fix them swiftly. Putting the innovation needs of a business into a third party is hard if you want to move quickly.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Perry needed to build up a technology team at Hertz that could be proactive in finding new solutions to their fast-paced business problems.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"That\\u2019s why she hired Focused Labs.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Focused Labs\\u2019 work with Hertz started in January of 2020. The company had been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic that globally put all travel to a standstill. Hertz needed to build technological solutions to pivot their business to encompass new ventures that could live outside of the usual model of renting cars direct to consumers.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"To do that, Hertz also needed to change the development culture. This transformation could leverage technology to discover new lines of business or improve older ways of working.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"\\u201cWe wanted fast help to get the work done,\\u201d says Perry, \\u201cbut also to embed the culture and ways of working that we want to be our target state.\\u201d\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Two Focused Labs developers paired with two members of the Hertz RevLab team to get to work. By working directly alongside team members of Hertz, they were able to learn the kinds of methods and curiosity Focused Labs keeps top of mind when developing a new piece of software.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Work between Focused Labs developers and the Hertz RevLab in Bannockburn, IL started with finding out what business opportunities currently exist and could exist in the future. They were looking for ways that technology could pivot to new business lines and software to support that business line could be built and deployed. The quicker a business can adjust to a market in flux, the more durable that business can become in the long term.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"The initial engagement between Hertz and Focused Labs started with a discovery process to identify areas in which Hertz may be underutilizing their existing vehicles. Through this process, they found that substantial time was being lost within the organization due to vehicle theft. It was time-consuming to identify a vehicle had been stolen and the longer the vehicle went undetected as stolen, the less likely it was to be returned.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Hertz RevLab and Focused Labs embarked on a project called SVU (stolen vehicles unit). The teams built and deployed a mobile application that allows the Hertz recovery team to detect, track and recover stolen vehicles. So far it has been wildly successful. In the first 3 months of use, numerous stolen Hertz vehicles were recovered \\u2014 which saved the company hundreds of thousands of dollars in inventory.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Working with stakeholders inside Hertz, including the executive team, helped Focused Labs to scope, shape, and prioritize the way software was ideated, built, and deployed into use.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"One of the business lines outside of Hertz's standard consumer rentals is TNC \\u2014 a program that rents vehicles to Uber and Lyft rideshare drivers. Often someone will decide against buying another vehicle or using their own in favor of renting a vehicle to drive customers where they need to go. Uber and Lyft are both technology-forward companies with everything necessary to their business living within an app on the driver and rider\\u2019s phones. Hertz needed a similarly easy-to-use portal for TNC partners to access all of the necessary compliance documents that come with standard rideshare agreements.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Being able to adjust to the needs of fast-paced markets like ridesharing is a big benefit to doing this work in an agile way. \\u201cWe\\u2019re no more than a week away from making a change in the iteration planning process.

There was an opportunity in the fact that delivery services were booming as so many people were no longer doing their shopping in person.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"In less than 3 weeks, Focused Labs and Hertz developers built an initial dispatching system to fulfill a new market for Hertz \\u2014 last-mile delivery. A retail partner hired Hertz to finish off deliveries they needed to reach their customers. This opened the door for Focused Labs to help develop that software.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"From July - November 2020:\"}\\n{\"p\": \"These pieces of software-enabled Hertz to provide the retailer with the capability to reach a broader customer delivery base.
