He wanted to both finish a project in a time crunch and extend the working relationships to guide his team toward a more agile way of developing software.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Aperture Health delivers provider management software for companies all across the healthcare space. Anderson\\u2019s goal in working with Focused Labs was to enhance his team\\u2019s ability to build and deploy complex, specific and impressive software to their clients.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"The first development project between Aperture and Focused Labs started in December of 2020. The previous team of developers had ended their contract before finishing the job, so understanding the work and its context was the biggest issue in getting started.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"The project needed to be finished quickly and Focused Labs was up for the challenge. \\u201cHaving partners who can quickly staff up like Focused is nice to have,\\u201d says Will Reed, former head of engineering at Aperture. \\u201cThey basically hopped onto a speeding train from a standstill.\\u201d\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Aperture needed Focused Labs to help build out a primary source verification (PSV) API for a client. PSV is the method a healthcare provider uses to verify someone has the right certificate, license or registration to practice a profession. This important piece of Aperture client\\u2019s work was taking weeks to accomplish due to lack of automation in sharing that data.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Focused Labs quickly built a self-service API that enabled Aperture\\u2019s client to accomplish PSV within hours \\u2014not days. By automating the data retrieval process between accreditor and provider, this software cut PSV requests \\u2014 which could manually take more than three days \\u2014 down to four hours. They further streamlined the process by then developing automated billing and invoicing for the API clients.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"And they delivered it all three weeks ahead of schedule.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"During this project, Focused Labs\\u2019 developers worked alongside Aperture\\u2019s to show the benefits of pair programming. Aperture wanted to move away from a waterfall type workflow to more iterative development. Focused Labs showed Aperture\\u2019s team the benefits of things like weekly team rituals and a cadenced release schedule for a project in progress.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Focused Labs also collaborated with Aperture to bring more modern tooling into their work environment. When partnering with development teams, Focused Labs always looks to implement new modern systems. With Aperture, the legacy applications they were previously working with made it virtually impossible to find out when the software Aperture was providing to its clients was faltering. To close that feedback loop between Aperture\\u2019s clients and Aperture, Focused Labs suggested and then implemented new tooling \\u2014 such as New Relic \\u2014 to facilitate performance monitoring. This way the client did not need to alert developers when things were breaking \\u2014 they now had the tools to monitor performance themselves.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Through working in a more collaborative, agile process, Aperture was able to solve problems in smaller chunks which led to a greater end result. Focused Labs also worked directly with Aperture\\u2019s client development team to mend the communication and relationship that had been strained by the contractors who left the project unfinished. This direct communication and collaboration has led to significant improvement in workflow and understanding between Aperture and their client stakeholders.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Aperture could have used any other development partner, but what was appealing about Focused Labs was the culture and workflow they were able to model with Aperture\\u2019s team.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Focused Labs are educators and modelers of new behaviors and new practices.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Our team brought the knowledge of the tech stack and Focused Labs were bringing tools in terms of how to work and how to gain confidence about the software that is being built.

BTR Energy\\u2019s platform connects EV manufacturers, fleet operators, and charging station networks to renewable electricity producers in order to generate LCFS \\u201ccredits\\u201d. Together, BTR Energy and its clients use charging data from EVs to make quarterly submissions to the California Air Resources Board and to generate LCFS credits. These credits can be sold, generating revenue for BTR Energy and its clients. BTR Energy keeps a small percentage of this revenue, providing the majority to the EV manufacturers, fleet operators, or charging station networks, and the renewable electricity producers.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Initially, BTR Energy managed all of its data in spreadsheets, but its platform now collects near real-time EV charging data and automatically processes that data and creates the reports necessary to generate LCFS credits, making it possible to manage a much larger amount of data from more and more diverse clients.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"The engagement between BTR Energy and Focused Labs started in early 2020. Focused Labs started by automating small parts of the manual spreadsheet based solution BTR Energy was using.

In addition to fielding the needs of client tech teams, a core responsibility of the Focused Labs team has been the constant improvement of BTR Energy\\u2019s security posture. For each integration, a robust security review is conducted by BTR Energy\\u2019s clients. BTR Energy trusts Focused Labs to field these reviews and strengthen their security with each subsequent one; BTR Energy is now compliant with hundreds of specific security requirements imposed on it by its clients.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Finally, BTR Energy relied on the Focused Labs team to demonstrate the software\\u2019s capabilities to investors during a funding round in August 2021.

Aperture\\u2019s engineers have embraced more pair programming work and significantly improved the daily working relationships between Aperture and client stakeholders.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Focused on Partnership: Aperture partnered with Focused Labs to imbue agile work states within their engineering teams while also quickly building software for a client. This will give Aperture a more agile approach to building and deploying valuable software going forward.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Aperture Health wanted to work smarter \\u2014 an agile transformation in product and software development was the direction they wanted to pursue. When a few software development contractors decided not to renew their work before finishing a project for Aperture\\u2019s client, Troy Anderson, chief production and information officer, saw an opportunity to partner with Focused Labs. He wanted to both finish a project in a time crunch and extend the working relationships to guide his team toward a more agile way of developing software.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"Aperture Health delivers provider management software for companies all across the healthcare space. Anderson\\u2019s goal in working with Focused Labs was to enhance his team\\u2019s ability to build and deploy complex, specific and impressive software to their clients.\"}\\n{\"p\": \"The first development project between Aperture and Focused Labs started in December of 2020.</td>\n      <td>468</td>\n      <td>[-0.008794023655354977, 0.002626438857987523, -0.0021432312205433846, -0.011625513434410095, -0.01727422885596752, 0.03417758271098137, -0.008066537790000439, -0.0019756241235882044, -0.015733670443296432, -0.03317907452583313, 0.034890804439783096, 0.024477768689393997, -0.001075181644409895, -0.01727422885596752, -0.007781248539686203, 0.004286462441086769, 0.018372591584920883, -0.033036429435014725, -0.013636798597872257, -0.02032681740820408, -0.03372112289071083, -0.008979461155831814, -0.01857229322195053, 0.015476910397410393, -0.027487564831972122, -0.007460298947989941, 0.0020540785044431686, -0.03203791752457619, -0.03266555443406105, -0.006775605957955122, 0.01955653913319111, 0.00316313817165792, -0.010355979204177856, 0.007474563550204039, 0.00824484322220087, -0.021767526865005493, -0.012609759345650673, 0.00398334302008152, 0.018458178266882896, -0.017559517174959183, 0.023949984461069107, 0.01641836389899254, -0.0045182593166828156, 0.001146503840573132, -0.0032879519276320934, -0.013715253211557865, -0.010420168749988079, 0.003496569348499179, -0.016133075580000877, 0.013429964892566204, 0.004468333907425404, 0.02005579322576523, -0.02322249859571457, 0.020483726635575294, 0.010398772545158863, -0.028642982244491577, -0.005106667522341013, 0.002626438857987523, 0.008943799883127213, -0.00567367859184742, -0.006130140274763107, 0.011532794684171677, -0.0177164264023304, 0.0031488738022744656, -0.01410752534866333, -0.0023750283289700747, 0.0059660994447767735, 0.014820747077465057, -0.004083194304257631, -0.005884078796952963, 0.04068216681480408, -0.00626208633184433, 0.023907192051410675, 0.014663837850093842, 0.020184174180030823, 0.01266681682318449, -0.01878625899553299, -0.02583288960158825, -0.004750056657940149, 0.013408567756414413, 0.008615718223154545, -0.021539295092225075, -0.02924208901822567, 0.029727080836892128, -0.005634451285004616, 0.015334266237914562, -0.03346436098217964, 0.008344694040715694, 0.013287319801747799, 0.004090326372534037, -0.0016154471086338162, 0.013572609052062035, 0.009143502451479435, 0.010848102159798145, -0.019442424178123474, 0.020555049180984497, 0.006993138696998358, -0.003517966018989682, -0.021567823365330696, -0.029185032472014427, ...]</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"
