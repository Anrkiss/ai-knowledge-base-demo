{"p": "Focused on Delivery: Built and deployed mobile application that allows the Hertz recovery team to detect, track and recover stolen vehicles. Built and deployed portal for TNC team to get necessary documents to rideshare renters. Developed software to build a last-mile delivery market."}
{"p": "Focused on Results: In the first 3 months of using the mobile app, the recovery of numerous stolen vehicles saved the company hundreds of thousands in inventory. The last-mile delivery app contributed to Hertz\u2019s bottom-line increase in revenue."}
{"p": "Focused on Partnership: Focused Labs built and deployed numerous applications with quick turnaround times \u2014 showing the developers at Hertz that technology solutions can be fast, functional, and profitable. Focused Labs took a very enablement-centric approach during the development process. Although Hertz had a very capable engineering team, they relied on Focused Labs to bring new, impactful, and sustainable engineering practices into their organization."}
{"p": "Diversifying lines of business is one of the best ways to leverage technology within a company. More and more, technology and outside forces are shaping industries in new, quick ways that can make age-old businesses feel like they are in a constant state of flux. For instance, car rental giant Hertz and similar companies were upended as the pandemic shut down almost all global travel and put the need to rent cars at a standstill. Technology has helped Hertz rebound and opens up new lines of business while also finding solutions to old problems. But they didn\u2019t always have the technology infrastructure to respond proactively to these issues."}
{"p": "Hertz hired Opal Perry as Global CIO \u2014 to rebuild a technology-forward culture that would see digital solutions as a way to grow new business and not just a functional necessity."}
{"p": "In the past, Hertz had outsourced a lot of its technology needs to external vendors. While it was functional for the ways technology had previously served Hertz, using outside vendors left their technology arm with a lack of innovation. An agile technology team within a business can know the pain points and work to fix them swiftly. Putting the innovation needs of a business into a third party is hard if you want to move quickly."}
{"p": "Perry needed to build up a technology team at Hertz that could be proactive in finding new solutions to their fast-paced business problems."}
{"p": "That\u2019s why she hired Focused Labs."}
{"p": "Focused Labs\u2019 work with Hertz started in January of 2020. The company had been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic that globally put all travel to a standstill. Hertz needed to build technological solutions to pivot their business to encompass new ventures that could live outside of the usual model of renting cars direct to consumers."}
{"p": "To do that, Hertz also needed to change the development culture. This transformation could leverage technology to discover new lines of business or improve older ways of working."}
{"p": "\u201cWe wanted fast help to get the work done,\u201d says Perry, \u201cbut also to embed the culture and ways of working that we want to be our target state.\u201d"}
{"p": "Two Focused Labs developers paired with two members of the Hertz RevLab team to get to work. By working directly alongside team members of Hertz, they were able to learn the kinds of methods and curiosity Focused Labs keeps top of mind when developing a new piece of software."}
{"p": "Work between Focused Labs developers and the Hertz RevLab in Bannockburn, IL started with finding out what business opportunities currently exist and could exist in the future. They were looking for ways that technology could pivot to new business lines and software to support that business line could be built and deployed. The quicker a business can adjust to a market in flux, the more durable that business can become in the long term."}
{"p": "The initial engagement between Hertz and Focused Labs started with a discovery process to identify areas in which Hertz may be underutilizing their existing vehicles. Through this process, they found that substantial time was being lost within the organization due to vehicle theft. It was time-consuming to identify a vehicle had been stolen and the longer the vehicle went undetected as stolen, the less likely it was to be returned."}
{"p": "Hertz RevLab and Focused Labs embarked on a project called SVU (stolen vehicles unit). The teams built and deployed a mobile application that allows the Hertz recovery team to detect, track and recover stolen vehicles. So far it has been wildly successful. In the first 3 months of use, numerous stolen Hertz vehicles were recovered \u2014 which saved the company hundreds of thousands of dollars in inventory."}
{"p": "Working with stakeholders inside Hertz, including the executive team, helped Focused Labs to scope, shape, and prioritize the way software was ideated, built, and deployed into use."}
{"p": "One of the business lines outside of Hertz's standard consumer rentals is TNC \u2014 a program that rents vehicles to Uber and Lyft rideshare drivers. Often someone will decide against buying another vehicle or using their own in favor of renting a vehicle to drive customers where they need to go. Uber and Lyft are both technology-forward companies with everything necessary to their business living within an app on the driver and rider\u2019s phones. Hertz needed a similarly easy-to-use portal for TNC partners to access all of the necessary compliance documents that come with standard rideshare agreements."}
{"p": "Being able to adjust to the needs of fast-paced markets like ridesharing is a big benefit to doing this work in an agile way. \u201cWe\u2019re no more than a week away from making a change in the iteration planning process. We\u2019ve gained speed-to-market and agility,\u201d says Brandon Mendoza, VP of Hertz\u2019s Transportation Network Company. \u201cNow we\u2019re never a week away from making a material change to our strategy.\u201d"}
{"p": "\u201cWe\u2019re no more than a week away from making a change in the iteration planning process. We\u2019ve gained speed-to-market and agility,\u201d says Brandon Mendoza, VP of Hertz\u2019s Transportation Network Company."}
{"p": "As the pandemic cut down on vehicle rentals, Hertz had to develop new ways to use the existing fleets of vehicles and staff still on hand. There was an opportunity in the fact that delivery services were booming as so many people were no longer doing their shopping in person."}
{"p": "In less than 3 weeks, Focused Labs and Hertz developers built an initial dispatching system to fulfill a new market for Hertz \u2014 last-mile delivery. A retail partner hired Hertz to finish off deliveries they needed to reach their customers. This opened the door for Focused Labs to help develop that software."}
{"p": "From July - November 2020:"}
{"p": "These pieces of software-enabled Hertz to provide the retailer with the capability to reach a broader customer delivery base. Hertz generated revenue that would not have been able to happen without quick technology solutions."}
{"p": "Hertz leveraged its logistics partnerships to fulfill last-mile deliveries. Focused Labs helped lead the team in building the software to make this highly profitable venture feasible."}
{"p": "In a short time-frame Hertz and Focused Labs:"}
{"p": "This extremely quick app deployment helped Hertz and its partner realize a material increase in package deliveries and generated a new stream of revenue. These quick turnarounds for such large deliverables proved out the methods of Focused Labs."}
{"p": "The deliverables in these quickly turned around projects is undeniable, which is why the partnership between Focused Labs and Hertz is still going. The number of Focused Labs developers engaged has increased to ten, to cover more ground in building and embedding culture. Thanks to Focused Labs\u2019 enablement approach, Hertz is steadily evolving its technology culture to be a place where the kind of agile developers who can deliver the best technology will want to work."}
{"p": "In hiring Focused Labs, Hertz not only gained agility and flexibility but also learned new engineering practices. Focused Labs helped show Hertz developers the kind of autonomy and confidence needed to build the right piece of software for right now."}

{"p": "Focused on Delivery: Replaced legacy manual spreadsheet process with software that was scalable for BTR Energy and clients. Software manages and records charging events for over 100,000 electric vehicles (EV), while also automating reporting to a California regulator and to BTR Energy\u2019s clients. Built and deployed a client-facing application for streamlining onboarding with BTR Energy\u2019s Bridge platform and the management of EV charging data."}
{"p": "Focused on Results: Software propelled BTR Energy\u2019s evolution from a software-enabled services company to a software-first product company for EV manufacturers and others."}
{"p": "Focused on Partnership: Focused Labs was trusted to serve as the technology arm of BTR Energy and has helped foster direct client relationships to build business-critical software. Developers at Focused Labs have become an integral part of BTR Energy\u2019s success and growth over the last year."}
{"p": "BTR Energy launched in 2019 to provide a platform that automates participation in low carbon fuels programs, like California\u2019s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS). BTR Energy\u2019s platform connects EV manufacturers, fleet operators, and charging station networks to renewable electricity producers in order to generate LCFS \u201ccredits\u201d. Together, BTR Energy and its clients use charging data from EVs to make quarterly submissions to the California Air Resources Board and to generate LCFS credits. These credits can be sold, generating revenue for BTR Energy and its clients. BTR Energy keeps a small percentage of this revenue, providing the majority to the EV manufacturers, fleet operators, or charging station networks, and the renewable electricity producers."}
{"p": "Initially, BTR Energy managed all of its data in spreadsheets, but its platform now collects near real-time EV charging data and automatically processes that data and creates the reports necessary to generate LCFS credits, making it possible to manage a much larger amount of data from more and more diverse clients."}
{"p": "The engagement between BTR Energy and Focused Labs started in early 2020. Focused Labs started by automating small parts of the manual spreadsheet based solution BTR Energy was using. BTR Energy understood that this legacy system would not be scalable and would not be able to meet the needs of its clients. As such, Focused Labs set out to build a better way to manage the data, improving and automating and BTR Energy\u2019s engagements with its clients."}
{"p": "BTR Energy needed scalable ways to catalog, analyze and share large amounts of charging data between EV manufacturers and regulators, while also preserving consumer privacy and a high \u2026 of data protection. Spreadsheets could not serve the business, so Focused Labs built the BTR Energy \u201cBridge\u201d platform, which includes direct integrations with its clients. This makes the transmission of EV charging data much more seamless for both BTR Energy and its clients."}
{"p": "Having an app to manage such a large amount of vehicle data and automating its delivery to the relevant regulator made it a valuable asset to both BTR Energy and their clients."}
{"p": "Since the development and deployment of the Bridge platform, BTR Energy has shifted from a software-enabled services business to a software-centric company."}
{"p": "\u201cThe software became the business,\u201d says Jack Barrow, CEO of BTR Energy."}
{"p": "Once the BTR Bridge Platform was deployed, BTR Energy needed a technology-forward strategy with its clients. Barrow and his partners at BTR Energy trusted Focused Labs\u2019 technology and people so much that they brought them to collaborative meetings with clients and prospects interested in integrating with BTR Energy\u2019s software. At the time, BTR Energy did not have a full in-house technology team, so Focused Labs developers took on that role."}
{"p": "Trusting an outside company to meet with your clients (especially when the potential client pool is relatively small) is not a role Focused Labs took lightly. \u201cWe were looking for technical talent, but also people with the ability to maintain a relationship \u2014 and we absolutely got that from Focused Labs,\u201d Barrow says. \u201cWe took [Focused Labs co-founders] Austin and Luke to Michigan to meet with one of our largest clients, and they just hit it off with everyone. I think it was helpful for BTR Energy\u2019s credibility.\u201d"}
{"p": "BTR Energy\u2019s trust in Focused Labs continues. Two developers from Focused Labs directly work with BTR Energy\u2019s client tech teams to address and manage business needs as they arrive. In addition to fielding the needs of client tech teams, a core responsibility of the Focused Labs team has been the constant improvement of BTR Energy\u2019s security posture. For each integration, a robust security review is conducted by BTR Energy\u2019s clients. BTR Energy trusts Focused Labs to field these reviews and strengthen their security with each subsequent one; BTR Energy is now compliant with hundreds of specific security requirements imposed on it by its clients."}
{"p": "Finally, BTR Energy relied on the Focused Labs team to demonstrate the software\u2019s capabilities to investors during a funding round in August 2021. This demonstration ultimately helped BTR secure those funds and advance the company forward."}
{"p": "\u201cClient and investor presentations are important moments for an early-stage company like BTR Energy. Just as Austin and Luke had made a positive impression on our clients in 2020, Focused Labs engineers made a positive impression on investors in 2021. Enthusiasm for BTR Energy noticeably grew after the presentations, and both investors that met the Focused Labs team ultimately participated in BTR Energy\u2019 Series A, a testament, in part, to the quality of the software and the presentations.\u201d"}
{"p": "Initially, the Bridge platform primarily supported work within BTR Energy \u2014 it was more functional than pretty. Once the business grew to work with automakers and their APIs, a client-facing friendly dashboard needed to be built. Focused Labs and BTR Energy collaborated to make and deploy a version of the Bridge platform for its clients."}
{"p": "Focused Labs developers and BTR Energy worked together to:"}
{"p": "Making integrations as easy as possible from the client side is paramount to BTR Energy\u2019s business plan. The easier it is for an automaker or other clients to directly onboard with BTR Energy\u2019s applications, the smoother the business relationship will be."}
{"p": "BTR Energy has grown significantly during its engagement with Focused Labs. As BTR Energy adapted to client needs, Focused Labs has been there to provide the technology and expertise needed for growth within tight timeframes. Eventually, BTR Energy will hire its own internal software development team, but the standards for building business changing software and doing so quickly will stand as the minimum. Focused Labs\u2019 core practices of pair programming, CI/CD, and test-driven development have laid a foundation that future BTR Energy developers can build on in the years to come."}

{"p": "The first development project between Aperture and Focused Labs started in December of 2020. The previous team of developers had ended their contract before finishing the job, so understanding the work and its context was the biggest issue in getting started."}
{"p": "The project needed to be finished quickly and Focused Labs was up for the challenge. \u201cHaving partners who can quickly staff up like Focused is nice to have,\u201d says Will Reed, former head of engineering at Aperture. \u201cThey basically hopped onto a speeding train from a standstill.\u201d"}
{"p": "Aperture needed Focused Labs to help build out a primary source verification (PSV) API for a client. PSV is the method a healthcare provider uses to verify someone has the right certificate, license or registration to practice a profession. This important piece of Aperture client\u2019s work was taking weeks to accomplish due to lack of automation in sharing that data."}
{"p": "Focused Labs quickly built a self-service API that enabled Aperture\u2019s client to accomplish PSV within hours \u2014not days. By automating the data retrieval process between accreditor and provider, this software cut PSV requests \u2014 which could manually take more than three days \u2014 down to four hours. They further streamlined the process by then developing automated billing and invoicing for the API clients."}
{"p": "And they delivered it all three weeks ahead of schedule."}
{"p": "During this project, Focused Labs\u2019 developers worked alongside Aperture\u2019s to show the benefits of pair programming. Aperture wanted to move away from a waterfall type workflow to more iterative development. Focused Labs showed Aperture\u2019s team the benefits of things like weekly team rituals and a cadenced release schedule for a project in progress."}
{"p": "Focused Labs also collaborated with Aperture to bring more modern tooling into their work environment. When partnering with development teams, Focused Labs always looks to implement new modern systems. With Aperture, the legacy applications they were previously working with made it virtually impossible to find out when the software Aperture was providing to its clients was faltering. To close that feedback loop between Aperture\u2019s clients and Aperture, Focused Labs suggested and then implemented new tooling \u2014 such as New Relic \u2014 to facilitate performance monitoring. This way the client did not need to alert developers when things were breaking \u2014 they now had the tools to monitor performance themselves."}
{"p": "Through working in a more collaborative, agile process, Aperture was able to solve problems in smaller chunks which led to a greater end result. Focused Labs also worked directly with Aperture\u2019s client development team to mend the communication and relationship that had been strained by the contractors who left the project unfinished. This direct communication and collaboration has led to significant improvement in workflow and understanding between Aperture and their client stakeholders."}
{"p": "Aperture could have used any other development partner, but what was appealing about Focused Labs was the culture and workflow they were able to model with Aperture\u2019s team."}
{"p": "Focused Labs are educators and modelers of new behaviors and new practices."}
{"p": "Our team brought the knowledge of the tech stack and Focused Labs were bringing tools in terms of how to work and how to gain confidence about the software that is being built. Everyone\u2019s adding value from day one,\u201d says Reed. \u201cFocused Labs are transferring their process to us and their job is to get out of here.\u201d"}
