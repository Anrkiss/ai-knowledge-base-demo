This article is super in-depth, \\nhttps://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html\\n. \\nThis notion page covers what pairing means to Focused Labs and why it is one of our core practices.\\n\\n\\nWhat is pairing to us?\\nIt's our default\\nIt's not just for blockers anymore! \\nPairing here consists of two equal partners writing code together: one computer, but two of everything else (monitors, keyboards & people).  After stand, each team determines their pairs for the day.  We try to rotate our pairs daily unless something that requires a lot of context is in-flight.  Throughout the day, we strive to help each other grow our skills and share knowledge about the codebase and tools we're using.\\n\\nWhile pairing is our default, it's a flexible practice.  Sometimes, you wind up with an odd-numbered team, so you solo for a day.  Sometimes, you might be on a one-pair team, and rotation isn't an issue. We might adjust the practice to current conditions ⛈, but it's a baseline practice here and something you should expect to spend a fair amount of time doing. \\n\\nPairing isn't only, a practice, it's also a skill.  Being a good pair involves being able to participate in constant feedback and collaboration, for more tips on being a good pair, keep on reading!\\nWhat is it NOT?\\nCode Reviews\\nCode review is a hard practice for little return. We have found pairing to be \\nfar \\nmore effective, especially for long term sustainability.\\nOccasionally for hard problems\\nPairing is a skill and like any skill, you can only get better at it by doing it.\\nIf you are working long term on a significant amount of code that is rote, your codebase is probably missing an abstraction. A pair will help you find the appropriate abstractions to avoid this in the future.\\nWhy default to pairing?\\nThe Martin Fowler article linked to above offers a whole host of reasons that pairing can be beneficial. Here are a few reasons that \\nwe\\n like to pair:\\n\\n💗  \\nPairing can improve quality of life as a dev. \\n Sometimes writing code solo can be fun and feel productive, but sometimes... it can go sideways. We've been there: rabbit-holed for hours on something that was essentially a typo 🤦\\u200d♂️. The recipient of a PR review filled with comments on using \\nconst\\n vs \\nlet\\n ...while leaving the architecture change you'd like feedback on unmentioned.  Receiving feedback on a feature that you'd spent hours on, and feeling personally attacked or like an impostor 🥊.  Pairing is great for preventing too-deep-in-the-weeds problems, because you've got someone there to pull you out, and a second set of eyes to see what you can't.  You can get \\nmeaningful\\n feedback on what you're writing from someone who has shared context and shared concerns. Finally, because responsibility for the code is distributed across the team, we can still have pride in crafting something well, without that feeling of ownership becoming possessive or defensive. Pairing distributes the burden and shares the joys.\\n\\n👷\\u200d♀️  \\nPairing is great for building teams.\\n  By working side-by-side with someone, you're encouraged to reconcile their way of thinking with your own.  Getting out of your own head like this can strengthen everyone's understanding of the task at hand, and fosters in-depth communication. By switching pairs frequently, no one person holds all the context, and knowledge is distributed across the team. In the event that you're onboarding to a new project, or have less experience in a given language or platform, pairing offers valuable learning opportunities beyond what the docs can provide.  And as the more experienced pair, it offers a chance to learn how to communicate your knowledge plainly (which is a valuable skill for consultants); also, nothing cements what you \\nthink\\n you know, like explaining it to someone else 😈. \\n\\n✨  \\nPairing makes for better code.  \\nThe act of talking through any given feature, optimizes the code in a few ways.  Communicating often requires clarifying your own thought process and getting immediate feedback on assumptions and understanding.  In making sure that the code that we're pairing on is clear to each other, the code becomes more readable for others and our future selves.  Given a diverse team, people come from different backgrounds (whether education, workplace, language preference or just personality), and that diversity gets passed along to the code's style and approach.  Plus, two sets of eyes means fewer bugs 🐛\\n\\n🦚  \\nPairing is just good practice.  \\n There are a few \\nFosters empathy\\nYou involve people in the design rather than the output\\nFast feedback loops\\nless possessiveness makes introducing client devs to the codebase easier\\n\\n\\nHow to be a good pair?\\nWe only get the benefits of pairing when we're being the best pair we can be.\\nAll around good advice:\\nListen first\\nTake breaks: frequent breaks are key to regaining focus, feeling better and being able to think on something in your own way\\nIf you're the confident type...\\nLet your pair to have equal time on the keyboard, and encourage them to drive if they're hesitant to take the keyboard\\nIf you're the person with more context/experience, bring your pair up to speed and don't just forge ahead without them\\nIf you're the introverted or struggles-with-impostor-syndrome type...\\nSpeak up: If you're feeling lost or out of context, don't be afraid to raise it. Calling out confusing code helps to make sure that it's written more clearly. \\n[ADD MORE]\\nTools!\\nTuple\\nScreen\\nAdditional resources on pairing\\nAustin's Built In Chicago \\ninterview\\nSome work station ideas: \\nhttps://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2011/08/25/mechanics-of-good-pairing/\\nhttp://llewellynfalco.blogspot.com/2014/06/llewellyns-strong-style-pairing.html?m=1\\nThere's a conference about how to make pairing more inclusive: \\nhttps://pearconf.splashthat.com/\", doc_id='707ba6ad-de73-4ce6-aca0-41e5b9646615', embedding=None, doc_hash='f18d90b9e9efd290b1eb70b801e9d6ee3642c8531fdf9e79bdc9b09591cdfcbf', extra_info={'page_id': '9f45258c6cab4592badeec6f1060e5df'}), Document(text=\"Love your craft\\nListen First\\nLearn Why\\nWhat is our culture\\nWe build our interactions around collaboration\\nWe deliver efficiently and fast\\nWhat defines our culture\\nThe people\\nDaily Practices\\nShared values around work output\\nour development approach & methodology \\nHow we communicate\\nThat we have clients\\nOur mission\\n\\nWhat does it mean love your craft\\nI take enjoyment out of what I do\\nI stay current on the latest and greatest\\nYou try to learn new things in your industry\\nYou can recognize bad craftsmanship\\nYou improve your approach\\nYou represent and showcase the value in quality\\n\\nWhy do we say craft\\nIt makes it an art form\\nCrafts can be continuously improved\\nThere are skills that are honed but never mastered\\nSits outside of specific technologies\\nLove your craft and use the tools rather than the other way around\\nThere's passion and dedication to quality.\\nI feel accountable for the output\\n\\nWhat tools are integral to our culture\\nPair Programming\\nTest driven development\\nCI/CD\\nGoogle\\n\", doc_id='eea05e6a-d60e-4653-b219-198996f86c5e', embedding=None, doc_hash='302213ae92209bf8c0874553fa77da22aaddc99bc90d399d780cbb07292a5d5e', extra_info={'page_id': 'c4e0d82f59d444c486066205919e2088'}), Document(text='🛫\\xa0\\nBooking and Expensing Flights\\nPlease book your flights to \\narrive in Chicago \\non the late afternoon/evening of Wednesday, August 9th.

It\\'s important that we understand why we replicated this interview and what the goal is.\\nWe use this exercise as our first interview because it is objective, repeatable, canned, and has a consistent scoring system. The exercise tests a candidate\\'s ability to implement an object oriented solution, test drive that solution, communicate about the code in that solution, and be empathetic to the boundaries we set. This interview is a great way to get a quick leading indicator of success and is a lot of fun!\\n\\t\\tThis interview \\n\\t\\tis\\n\\t\\t a leading indicator of success\\n\\t\\tThis interview \\n\\t\\tis not\\n\\t\\t a 1 to 1 evaluation of the candidates skill\\n\\nInterviewer Overview\\nThe interview takes somewhere between 30 minutes - 1 hour to complete. The time it takes to finish is not an indicator of the competency or quality of the candidate. \\nDuring the hour the interviewer will guide the candidate through developing a \\nSet\\n class in Java through test driven development.\\nIt\\'s the interviewers job to finish the entire exercise in the allotted time no-matter the candidates performance.\\nThe job of the interviewer is to make the time a productive, friendly, and kind experience with the candidate. Make sure you evaluate fairly.\\nYou should avoid using your mouse at all costs and know the key bindings like the back of your hand.\\nRemember every interview should end exactly the same.\\nScoring\\nScoring Rubric\\nThis interview is scored from 100 - 0 (although it\\'s rare to keep a score lower than 85).\\nWhen the interview starts the candidate is given 100 points. During the interview as we ask questions of the candidate the interviewer will either add or remove points from a candidate. It is possible, although very rare, for a candidate to score over 100.\\nLosing Points\\nA candidate can lose points for the following:\\nIt\\'s at the discretion of the interviewer when to remove a point and how many to remove. Your judgment is based on if they are discussing a solution with you, or need you to give them an answer. That said, there are consistent places throughout the exercise where points are deducted.\\nGetting a question wrong\\nTaking too long to answer\\nSitting silent and not communicating\\nInsistent that an approach is correct after the guidance of the interviewer\\nGenerally not being nice or reflecting our values\\nEarning Points\\nWe often ask similar questions more than once or coach a candidate to a solution. As a test for aptitude the interviewer should give points back to a candidate if they previously missed something that they then got correct.\\nCandidates can also earn points by spotting bugs, being exceptionally clever or smart, or having elevated conversations about the \\nwhy\\n of how the code is being written or structured\\nEnvironment\\nIntelliJ should be set up with two panes side by side.

They are a contributing developer to the team with additional responsibilities and authority that is accountable for the technical success of the engagement.

Instead, their main responsibility is to guide the team's technical decisions and ensure that ownership is delegated effectively while maintaining accountability for Focus Labs's high standards of execution.\\nThe allocations team determines who the Tech Lead is for a project. This is a project-specific title that a developer holds only for the duration of that project.\\nTechnical\\nThe tech lead should not make decisions alone or hoard all technical project context. Instead, they should work to align the team's technical direction and incorporate feedback from other developers in order to make the strongest technical decisions possible. The tech lead does not need to be an expert in the tech stack or domain when they start a project, but are expected to learn quickly and leverage their team and existing knowledge to make informed decisions.\\nThe tech lead should lead by example and is expected write code and actively participate in development. They should spend at least 80% of their time pairing with the rest of the team. This is critical for preventing knowledge silos, guiding decisions in the codebase, and maintaining a high level of quality.\\nConsulting\\nThe tech lead is not only a technical leader but also a trusted technical partner whom the client seeks out for advice, perspective, and concrete solutions. They should expand their sphere of influence beyond the core team and build relationships with other client teams. This is critical for understanding the client's technical landscape, so that the tech lead can make the best technical decisions based on the client's current position.\\nLeadership\\nLeadership on a team is shared with other roles. The product manager and designer collaborate on \\nwhat\\n to build while the tech lead is accountable for \\nhow\\n to build. The tech lead guides the team's technical direction, delegates responsibilities effectively, and is accountable for Focused Labs's high standards of execution. They generate consensus when then can, and make decisions when necessary.\\nResponsibilities of the Tech Lead\\nEnsuring that the team is following core Focused Labs dev practices, including always delivering working software, TDD, CI/CD, pairing and pair rotations, managing technical debt, preventing knowledge silos, etc.\\nEnsuring that the product is production-ready by making sure that \\ncross functional\\n requirements are met, including performance, security, scalability, monitoring, logging, documentation, etc.\\nUnderstanding the technical requirements of the product and client, and working closely with  PM and design \\nto ensure \\nthey\\n are prioritized in the backlog\\n supports continuously shipping working software\\nEnsuring architecture decisions fit product and client needs\\nConsulting the client on technical best practices and advocating for XP\\n core practices\\nGrowing their sphere of influence outside of the core team by establishing and maintaining relationships with \\nclient technical teams\\n and enterprise architects, including teams working in the same product area, DevOps, security, etc.\\nCommunicating technical risks, wins, and allocation needs to the Delivery Lead\\nMost Effective Tech Leads…\\nDelegate responsibilities rather than doing everything themselves.\\n Although the Tech Lead is accountable for the success of team initiatives, it is unlikely that they will be able to effectively do everything by themselves. Tech Leads should seek to empower their team by removing obstacles, transferring ownership, and avoiding micromanagement. They use authority tactfully and hold team members accountable.\\nCollaborate closely with their cross-functional peers and client leadership.\\n Success is rarely tied solely to technical outcomes. Effective Tech Leads work with product, design, architecture, and other teams to make informed decisions. They are a technical \\npartner\\n and make informed decisions in the context of a client’s technical landscape.\\nContribute to a healthy team environment by setting an example.\\n Good leaders seek feedback often to make course corrections. They have a good sense of team morale and promote open communication among team members to proactively prevent interpersonal conflict. They address team issues directly and escalate when necessary.\\nAct as a \\nprimary \\npoint of contact but not the \\nonly \\npoint of contact. \\nAn effective Tech Lead manages their time well. They build client relationships while balancing their time as a technical contributor.

The purpose is to talk about how the day went, reflect on what went well, and determine if there are ways the pair can collaborate better in the future.

During pair retros, it\\'s essential to engage in meaningful conversations with your pair, even if you feel aren\\'t any significant concerns to address. These conversations provide an excellent opportunity to connect with your pair and allow them to express their thoughts about how the day went. It\\'s a great way to reflect on what went well throughout the day and identify areas where you can improve your collaboration in future pairing sessions. Additionally, these conversations provide insight into your pair’s working style, which can help you understand them better and optimize future pairing sessions. So, it\\'s highly recommended that you take advantage of every pair retro session, even if you don\\'t have any big concerns to address.\\nWhat if I don’t have any critical feedback for my pair?\\n\\tIt\\'s okay to not always have critical feedback! Take a moment to see what could have been improved, but if a pairing session went really well, that\\'s great. There\\'s no need to force feedback just for the sake of finding something to criticize. However, changing your perspective can sometimes be helpful when thinking about feedback. We often think of pair feedback as simply \"critical\", but it can also be a valuable tool for understanding each other\\'s strengths and desires for growth. By doing so, you can optimize your partnership and support your pair in achieving their goals for growth.\\n\\t\\tIf you and your pair were working in the physical world, building a complicated structure and the plans were continuously in flux, and you were collaborating  on a physical task, what worked today and what didn’t work today?

In order for the business to sustain itself in the short term and grow in the long term the company needs a larger and more reliable pipeline of new clients and projects. Creating a strong association of our thought leadership with the Focused Labs logo will increase the opportunity for collisions with potential clients, equip our sales team with a stronger narrative for close, and attract top talent.\\n\\tIn order to establish ourselves as thought leaders we need a combination of individual recognizable personalities, re-usable content (written or otherwise), and consistency of presence in a variety of mediums.\\nA \\nVision for \\nThought Leadership\\nThought leadership is a core part of our strategic vision for Focused Labs in becoming a “badge of honor” that amazing people to seek to have on their resume. Practitioners that spend time at Focused Labs should be proud to have Focused Labs as a part of their professional work history, confident that it will open up incredible opportunities for their career. In order for our peers and industry to share in celebrating that badge of honer they first need to be aware of it. Our 2023 vision for thought leadership is all about getting out there so that everyone knows who Focused Labs is and what are thought leaders on.\\nFirst Goal\\nAs a starting point, we need to focus on \\ncreating habitual behavior\\n in publishing content that expresses all the amazing things that we already are doing. Our high level strategy is to categorize and deliberately target content at two distinct (but not mutually exclusive) audiences: buyers and practitioners.\\n\\nPractitioner Audience\\n\\tWe need Focused Labs to become a trusted source of high quality content for practitioners who are looking to hone their craft. I personally think about sources like \\n\\tBaeldung\\n\\t, \\n\\tSilicon Valley Product Group\\n\\t, or \\n\\tMartin Fowler’s blog\\n\\t as examples of reputable and reliable sources of high quality content.\\n\\tSome examples:\\n\\tIf I am looking to understand a particular coding pattern in the Spring framework I will scroll past StackOverflow and Medium results and jump to the Baeldung result first because I know it’s concise and accurate every time. \\n\\tPerhaps I am looking for some additional reading to send to a client after a conversation about iteratively evolving software architecture. Martin Fowler’s blog is the first place I’m going to find supporting material.\\n\\tPerhaps, my client isn’t familiar with writing or using Gherkin style acceptance criteria. I send them \\n\\tthis blog\\n\\t to read before we get together to pair on the first set of stories for our backlog.\\n\\tYou identify that one of the sources of pain for your client company in adopting a more agile and empowered team way of working is that communication between the team and leadership is broken. You send \\n\\tthis overview\\n\\t of how to write great executive summaries from Reforge to your client to consider and then get together to make a plan on next steps to improve communication on this team.\\n\\t[need some design centric examples, help!] Design systems, Research best practices, How to critique and evaluate interfaces etc.\\n\\n\\tWhile those examples set a pretty high bar, remember our first step is to \\n\\tcreate habitual behavior\\n\\t. We can be thoughtful about areas of focus and excellence but we don’t want that to be a blocker. Let’s not let the enemy of good be perfect.\\n\\n\\tContent Budgets\\n\\tStarting on March 1st, 2023 each of our practices (Product, Design, Engineering, DevOps, and Delivery Lead) will have monthly content budgets for their departments to use in order to generate content. Directors will be accountable for making sure that resources are allocated and content is produced but the expectation is that individuals are responsible for creating the content itself.\\n\\n\\tContent Guide\\n\\tWe don\\'t want to constrain creativity. At the same time a blank canvas can be a difficult place to start. Below are some ideas to get the gears turning. \\n\\t has put together a great guide to get you started on \\n\\tdifferent forms and voices of written content\\n\\t.\\n\\n\\tWho exactly are we writing this for?\\n\\tThink about writing to your fellow Focused folks and to your future self. We create some pretty incredible patterns, team dynamics, and solutions on every project. Writing down interesting solutions may be something you or your peers will find valuable on the next project!\\n\\tOther practitioners of your craft. The goal is to share our skills out with the world. We do some pretty incredible things when it comes to building software and we can help other practitioners learn from what we do.\\n\\tOther teams within a current client. When we help large enterprise clients establish better ways of working, more effective software testing strategies, or develop outcome oriented roadmaps you better believe there are other teams within the organization struggling with similar issues.\\n\\tYourself. Creating a brand and a history of content is something that you can reference and carry with you throughout your career.\\n\\n\\tWhat exactly are we supposed to be writing about?\\n\\tIt\\'s really easy to convince yourself that an idea might not be all that interesting or interesting to everyone. Beware of getting blocked. Seek feedback from your peers.\\n\\tThought Leadership isn’t always novel or revolutionary. Rather it can be a unique repacking of a few ideas or the implementation of a theory in practice.\\n\\tWrite about what you are doing today, it\\'s already quite extraordinary.\\n\\tThink about the things we do that are differentiating. Our practices may seem routine because we do them all the time here at Focused Labs, but are they industry standard? Think about the ah-ha moments that you have had with clients and teams. Tell a story.\\n\\tAsk yourself about what things you find yourself having to introduce to most new clients. Let’s create a toolbox full of getting started with Focused Labs supporting materials.\\n\\tStart small. Our initial goal is to create habitual behavior. Default to quantity over quality, then evaluate quality.\\n\\n\\tWhat types of content are we aiming for?\\n\\tWritten form content has the lowest barrier to entry and is the best place to start forming habitual behavior. We strongly encourage everyone to start there.\\n\\tWe are open to other types of content and don’t want to constrain creativity. If you have another medium that you are interested in meet with your Director and to make a case and expect feedback.\\n\\n\\t\\tHow to find a topic a\\n\\t\\t\\tThink \\n\\t\\t\\tAngles, not topics using STRIC\\n\\t\\t\\tFew people want to read an overview of a topic.

Each week I tackle reader questions about \\nproduct, growth, working with humans, and anything else that’s stressing\\n you out at the office.\\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\tSend me your questions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\xa0and in return I’ll humbly offer actionable real-talk advice.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tQ: I’ve been a PM at a mid-sized company for a couple of years now, and\\nI’m still not sure what skills I should be building to be\\nsuper-successful long term. What are the most important set of skills a\\nPM needs to develop?\\n\\t\\t\\tInstead of pontificating,\\n let’s get real. There’s no better way to know what skills matter most \\nin your role than by looking at how your company evaluates your \\nperformance. If you’re lucky, your manager has shared what’s called a \\ncareer ladder (also known as a \\n\\t\\t\\tleveling framework\\n\\t\\t\\t, \\n\\t\\t\\tcareer map\\n\\t\\t\\t, \\n\\t\\t\\trole guideline\\n\\t\\t\\t, \\n\\t\\t\\tcompetencies\\n\\t\\t\\t, or \\n\\t\\t\\tattributes list)\\n\\t\\t\\t, which lays out the concrete expectations for your role at your level. Here’s an example from \\n\\t\\t\\tIntercom’s PM career ladder\\n\\t\\t\\t for a Senior PM:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tIf your company doesn’t have such a thing, or you’re pining for something more, this post is for you.\\n\\t\\t\\tOver\\n the past year, I’ve collected over twenty PM career ladders from \\ncompanies like Uber, Slack, Airbnb, Intercom, Amazon, and Asana. After \\nanalyzing these documents, it’s become clear to me that (1) the PM role \\nvaries significantly across company, but (2) there are a set of ten core\\n PM skills that will serve you well no matter where you work.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn this post I’ll share:\\n\\t\\t\\tThe ten most important PM jobs, based on what these 20+ companies look for in their PMs\\n\\t\\t\\tWhat separates junior PMs from senior PMs\\n\\t\\t\\tA template to build your own career ladder\\n\\t\\t\\tNine public PM career ladders to inspire your thinking\\n\\t\\t\\tSome fun facts about these career ladders\\n\\t\\t\\tLet’s dive in.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe top 10 jobs of a product manager\\n\\t\\t\\tAfter spending \\n\\t\\t\\tcountless\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n hours reading through every career ladder I could get my hands on, I \\npresent the top ten most important jobs of a product manager:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t1. Leadership\\n\\t\\t\\tSurprisingly,\\n though not so surprisingly (since PMs are generally de facto leaders of\\n their team), leadership ended up being the single most cited PM skill, \\nhighlighted by 85% of the companies (all but three).\\n\\t\\t\\tHere’s how companies describe strong PM leadership:\\n\\t\\t\\t“Inspires teams to achieve great outcomes. Pushes team when they need to be pushed, and supports teams when they need support.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Role models servant-leadership.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Demonstrates ability to effectively motivate a large team of engineers. Can\\nsuccessfully start and direct self-sustaining teams. Routinely lobbies\\nfor and wins resources.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Spreads best practices across the product team to make everyone better.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Demonstrated mentorship and development of other product managers.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Consistently and actively assists others in expanding and developing skills and\\nknowledge, particularly fellow Product Managers.”\\n\\t\\t\\t2. Execution\\n\\t\\t\\tExecution (aka, getting sh*t done) turned out to be the second most important PM attribute, highlighted by 75% of companies.\\n\\t\\t\\tHere’s how companies describe strong execution:\\n\\t\\t\\t“Keeps the team aligned on vision, goals, and strategy over 6-month periods.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Focuses, runs, and plans across a series of teams that operate seamlessly with\\nminimal blockage, minimal noise, and a rapid clip of high-quality\\ndelivery. Others frequently turn to this person to understand how to run highly productive teams.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Priorities for a team are clear and trade-offs are well understood.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Delivers almost always on goals and strategy, covering 12-month long product initiatives spanning multiple teams or domains.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“When an execution failure happens, they take ownership, explain what was learned, and rapidly remedy the problem.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Identifies issues that will keep the product from delivering on\\n\\t\\t\\ttime and/or with the desired requirements and communicates to leadership;\\nassesses the alternatives to resolve (“path to green”) and builds a plan for resolution.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Works in a fluid nature to\\ncreatively scope projects to get more out of teams than they thought\\npossible. Consistently makes the complex simple.”\\n\\t\\t\\t3. Strategy\\n\\t\\t\\tAbout\\n 75% of companies also highlight strategy as a critical PM attribute, \\nwhich when combined with the previous two jobs (leadership and \\nexecution) basically tells you what companies need PMs for most.\\n\\t\\t\\tHere’s what great strategy looks like:\\n\\t\\t\\t“Can take ambiguous, large product spaces and create principles / focused\\nstrategy to organize a wider team along with product plan.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Can connect the dots across pillars, industries, and trends for maximum strategic impact.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Has the capability to set strategies and coach the delivery of chunks of\\nvalue to customers at the right intervals on the road to their vision.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Focuses their teams on the most important problems, but opens their eyes to\\nproblems they don’t realize they\\'re going to have. Also ensures that\\nproblems are owned—even if it\\'s not their teams.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Articulates a path to achieve results for a product area.”\\n\\t\\t\\t4. Communication\\n\\t\\t\\tPMs\\n do their job through one core skill: communication—by talking, \\nemailing, writing, messaging, and presenting. Unsurprisingly, the fourth\\n most frequently mentioned PM attribute, emphasized by over 60% of \\ncompanies, is communication.\\n\\t\\t\\tHere’s what great communication looks like:\\n\\t\\t\\t“Demonstrates strong verbal and written communication skills in interactions with\\nteam and product stakeholders. Supports communication about team’s work\\nto executives and company at large.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Your oral and\\ninformal written communications (Slack, doc comments, etc.) are clear\\nand efficient, and people feel heard in your discussions with them. You\\nchoose the right venue and level of formality for your communications.\\nYou serve as an effective conduit for information and understanding up\\nand down your reporting chain and outward to stakeholders.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Communicates concisely, influences outcomes, and messages crisply so as to be\\nrecounted by partners. Speaks in front of large groups with confidence\\nand clarity. Succinctly summarizes key points to leaders in written and\\nverbal form.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Communicates effectively and directly to\\nexecutives and company at-large about their team’s work to gather\\nfeedback, generate alignment, and garner support.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Able\\nto structure an entire storyline across various media (presentations,\\nvideos, documents, sales collateral) to drive engagement and adoption\\nwithin their product area.”\\n\\t\\t\\t5. Deliver impact\\n\\t\\t\\tAll the other skills in this list enable the thing that matters most in the end: delivering impact. Impact is the \\n\\t\\t\\toutput\\n\\t\\t\\t of all the inputs in this list.\\n\\t\\t\\tHere’s what successfully delivering impact looks like:\\n\\t\\t\\t“Shows quantifiable impact by hitting aggressive goals that move metrics for a product area.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Hits dramatically important, broad goals that signal realization of\\nambitious visions. This can be both internal or external product\\nlaunches, tech debt reduction, or infrastructure improvements.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Ships a large-sized project during each quarter. Projects make a positive, quantifiable impact on the product group’s KPIs.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Demonstrated track record of delivering step function improvement to the business and customers.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Drives impact by making a project as successful as possible in the context of their team’s broader strategy.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Consistently delivers meaningful impact to customers and our business.”\\n\\t\\t\\t6. Leverage customer insights and data\\n\\t\\t\\tAbout\\n 50% of the companies highlight the job of leveraging data and user \\nresearch. It’s interesting that this only came up in half of companies. \\nMy take is that the remaining companies assume this is going to happen \\nanyway.\\n\\t\\t\\tHere’s what what being great at this job looks like:\\n\\t\\t\\t“Talks to a range of customers using their area of product and beyond, always\\nlooking for deeper insight. Is recognized internally as an expert in\\ncustomer needs for their area of product. Is able to use this insight to effectively create the best possible value in their product area.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Able to derive insights from data to support new product bets.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Anchors decisions in data. Uses data insights to evaluate and inform the story\\nthey tell. Uses data insights to inform product strategy and partners\\neffectively with Analytics to define the analysis we need. Can\\nindependently seek and evaluate their own data insights.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Serves as effective \\n\\t\\t\\tfirst line\\n\\t\\t\\t for team members in terms of evaluating their insights and interpretation and steering them accordingly.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Works with engineering effectively to ensure instrumentation/data model supports key questions to be answered.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Engages externally with customers to identify key product issues in market; solicits feedback on product roadmap.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“For their teams, oversees a comprehensive research plan into their\\ncustomers (who they are, what they need, how they use the products) and a systematic process for using this research to develop product\\nfeatures.”\\n\\t\\t\\t“Leverages data analysis skills to research\\ndifficult or ambiguous problems, leading cross-disciplinary teams where\\nnecessary and communicating recommendations to senior leadership.”\\n\\n\\tWhen you start working on a piece of content, drop a title, short description, your name, and status in the table below. We’ll use this table to collaborate and avoid duplicative work. If someone started something you’re excited about and the status isn’t done, ping them to see if you can collaborate!\\n\\n\\t\\tNon-obvious ways to come up with product and feature ideas.\\n\\t\\t“What do you think we should build?”\\n\\t\\tThe essential product management question can also be a vexing one.\\n\\t\\tAs much as we get into product management to delight customers with the next amazing idea, we’ve all felt lost at one time or another when it comes to knowing what to build next.\\n\\t\\tFear not, for below, you’ll find a variety of methods to conjure up product, feature, and solution ideas in any context.\\n\\t\\tCustomer Misbehavior\\n\\t\\tEmbrace strangeness - lookout for customers using your product in unusual or unanticipated ways. Are users doing something that you didn’t plan for or officially support?\\n\\t\\tIf so, do some homework:\\n\\t\\tWhat was happening that caused them to try your product for <unconventional use case> in the first place?\\n\\t\\tWhat unexpected utility did they find in your product?\\n\\t\\tWhat problem are they solving?\\n\\t\\tThen, build to support the new use case.\\n\\t\\tExamples:\\n\\t\\t😈 eBay.\\n\\t\\t Customers began selling things they didn’t officially support; concert tickets, fine art, and even cars. This inspired dedicated areas for more specific purchases like \\n\\t\\teBay Motors\\n\\t\\t.\\n\\t\\t😈 Instagram.\\n\\t\\t An early version was called 🥃 Burbn and focused on social check-ins. Users didn’t adopt the check-in feature but went crazy uploading photos, leading the team to focus on photo sharing.\\n\\t\\t😈 Play-Doh\\n\\t\\t started out as Kutol, a cleaning compound for wallpaper.

This article is super in-depth, \\n\\thttps://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html\\n\\t. \\n\\tThis notion page covers what pairing means to Focused Labs and why it is one of our core practices.\\n\\n\\n\\tWhat is pairing to us?\\n\\tIt\\'s our default\\n\\tIt\\'s not just for blockers anymore! \\n\\tPairing here consists of two equal partners writing code together: one computer, but two of everything else (monitors, keyboards & people).  After stand, each team determines their pairs for the day.  We try to rotate our pairs daily unless something that requires a lot of context is in-flight.  Throughout the day, we strive to help each other grow our skills and share knowledge about the codebase and tools we\\'re using.\\n\\n\\tWhile pairing is our default, it\\'s a flexible practice.  Sometimes, you wind up with an odd-numbered team, so you solo for a day.  Sometimes, you might be on a one-pair team, and rotation isn\\'t an issue. We might adjust the practice to current conditions ⛈, but it\\'s a baseline practice here and something you should expect to spend a fair amount of time doing. \\n\\n\\tPairing isn\\'t only, a practice, it\\'s also a skill.  Being a good pair involves being able to participate in constant feedback and collaboration, for more tips on being a good pair, keep on reading!\\n\\tWhat is it NOT?\\n\\tCode Reviews\\n\\tCode review is a hard practice for little return. We have found pairing to be \\n\\tfar \\n\\tmore effective, especially for long term sustainability.\\n\\tOccasionally for hard problems\\n\\tPairing is a skill and like any skill, you can only get better at it by doing it.\\n\\tIf you are working long term on a significant amount of code that is rote, your codebase is probably missing an abstraction. A pair will help you find the appropriate abstractions to avoid this in the future.\\n\\tWhy default to pairing?\\n\\tThe Martin Fowler article linked to above offers a whole host of reasons that pairing can be beneficial. Here are a few reasons that \\n\\twe\\n\\t like to pair:\\n\\n\\t💗  \\n\\tPairing can improve quality of life as a dev. \\n\\t Sometimes writing code solo can be fun and feel productive, but sometimes... it can go sideways. We\\'ve been there: rabbit-holed for hours on something that was essentially a typo 🤦\\u200d♂️. The recipient of a PR review filled with comments on using \\n\\tconst\\n\\t vs \\n\\tlet\\n\\t ...while leaving the architecture change you\\'d like feedback on unmentioned.  Receiving feedback on a feature that you\\'d spent hours on, and feeling personally attacked or like an impostor 🥊.  Pairing is great for preventing too-deep-in-the-weeds problems, because you\\'ve got someone there to pull you out, and a second set of eyes to see what you can\\'t.  You can get \\n\\tmeaningful\\n\\t feedback on what you\\'re writing from someone who has shared context and shared concerns. Finally, because responsibility for the code is distributed across the team, we can still have pride in crafting something well, without that feeling of ownership becoming possessive or defensive. Pairing distributes the burden and shares the joys.\\n\\n\\t👷\\u200d♀️  \\n\\tPairing is great for building teams.\\n\\t  By working side-by-side with someone, you\\'re encouraged to reconcile their way of thinking with your own.  Getting out of your own head like this can strengthen everyone\\'s understanding of the task at hand, and fosters in-depth communication. By switching pairs frequently, no one person holds all the context, and knowledge is distributed across the team. In the event that you\\'re onboarding to a new project, or have less experience in a given language or platform, pairing offers valuable learning opportunities beyond what the docs can provide.  And as the more experienced pair, it offers a chance to learn how to communicate your knowledge plainly (which is a valuable skill for consultants); also, nothing cements what you \\n\\tthink\\n\\t you know, like explaining it to someone else 😈. \\n\\n\\t✨  \\n\\tPairing makes for better code.  \\n\\tThe act of talking through any given feature, optimizes the code in a few ways.  Communicating often requires clarifying your own thought process and getting immediate feedback on assumptions and understanding.  In making sure that the code that we\\'re pairing on is clear to each other, the code becomes more readable for others and our future selves.  Given a diverse team, people come from different backgrounds (whether education, workplace, language preference or just personality), and that diversity gets passed along to the code\\'s style and approach.  Plus, two sets of eyes means fewer bugs 🐛\\n\\n\\t🦚  \\n\\tPairing is just good practice.  \\n\\t There are a few \\n\\tFosters empathy\\n\\tYou involve people in the design rather than the output\\n\\tFast feedback loops\\n\\tless possessiveness makes introducing client devs to the codebase easier\\n\\n\\n\\tHow to be a good pair?\\n\\tWe only get the benefits of pairing when we\\'re being the best pair we can be.\\n\\tAll around good advice:\\n\\tListen first\\n\\tTake breaks: frequent breaks are key to regaining focus, feeling better and being able to think on something in your own way\\n\\tIf you\\'re the confident type...\\n\\tLet your pair to have equal time on the keyboard, and encourage them to drive if they\\'re hesitant to take the keyboard\\n\\tIf you\\'re the person with more context/experience, bring your pair up to speed and don\\'t just forge ahead without them\\n\\tIf you\\'re the introverted or struggles-with-impostor-syndrome type...\\n\\tSpeak up: If you\\'re feeling lost or out of context, don\\'t be afraid to raise it. Calling out confusing code helps to make sure that it\\'s written more clearly. \\n\\t[ADD MORE]\\n\\tTools!\\n\\tTuple\\n\\tScreen\\n\\tAdditional resources on pairing\\n\\tAustin\\'s Built In Chicago \\n\\tinterview\\n\\tSome work station ideas: \\n\\thttps://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2011/08/25/mechanics-of-good-pairing/\\n\\thttp://llewellynfalco.blogspot.com/2014/06/llewellyns-strong-style-pairing.html?m=1\\n\\tThere\\'s a conference about how to make pairing more inclusive: \\n\\thttps://pearconf.splashthat.com/\\n\\tWhat is TDD?\\n\\tTDD stands for \\n\\tTest Driven Development. \\n\\tIn brief, it means writing tests \\n\\tbefore\\n\\t you write your implementation code. You use your tests to prescribe how a unit of code or system \\n\\tshould \\n\\tfunction from an outside perspective, and then you write implementation code to match that prescription.\\n\\tWhy do we TDD? \\n\\tWe TDD for two reasons, to \\n\\ttighten feedback loops \\n\\tand \\n\\tde-risk change. \\n\\n\\tLet’s get one thing out of the way, everyone tests their code. Whether you’re running a local environment to check if a button works, spinning up a local copy of an API, deploying to a dev environment for QA to regression, or deploying straight to production, your code gets tested. What makes TDD stand apart is that the feedback on functioning code is much \\n\\tfaster\\n\\t. \\n\\n\\tA good test suite gives you the confidence that your new change doesn’t break existing functionality. It reduces the amount of regressions you’ll see on deployed software. TDD and CI/CD go hand in hand. If you want the ability to move fast and incrementally, you need good tests. Note that \\n\\tde-risking change \\n\\tisn’t the same as \\n\\teliminating \\n\\tit. You will have production fires and bugs even if you use TDD. But after you fix them, you’ll write a test and never see them again. \\n\\tCode As Living Documentation\\n\\tIt’s a cliche for sure, but your test suite truly acts as living documentation for your code. New developers can use test code to understand how it functions. When presented with a challenging piece of implementation code, good tests empower you to edit that code and see what breaks. You can use the test code to explore the development of a domain over time, or follow along with an entire business flow. Good tests give new developers confidence. \\n\\tTDD is Good For Developer Morale\\n\\tRemember learning to code for the first time? Writing something like a hello world program? Programming is fun! Especially when you can see the positive effects you’re effecting as you go. In a non-tested or poorly tested codebase with long startup and lots of dependencies, that visibility disappears pretty fast. It could be minutes or hours before you see your software work, and programming becomes a slog. TDD lets you see it work (almost) immediately, and you get a little dopamine on every green run. \\n\\tCommon Counterpoints\\n\\tWhy not write tests after? \\n\\tWriting tests before implementation means our frame of reference for code is always coming from how that software needs to be used and interacted, rather than how it works internally. \\n\\n\\tA key component of a well written test suite is that it is \\n\\timplementation-unaware. \\n\\tThis is important because implementation aware tests can easily devolve into a brittle test suite that does not serve its primary purpose, which is to protect the \\n\\tbusiness \\n\\tfunctionality of software, not to enforce a particular design choice. By writing tests before your implementation, you cannot write implementation aware tests. A well written unit test should allow you to change the implementation of the code (make it faster, change the pattern, etc) without altering the test. \\n\\n\\tIt’s not impossible to write good unit tests after the fact, it’s just harder. You’re fighting your own bias that way, and you don’t get the feedback as you code.\\n\\n\\tDoesn’t writing tests mean you take twice as long?\\n\\tNot really. Remember, everyone tests their code. What’s faster, writing a ten line unit test to check that button you just implemented, or restarting your app and then trying it by hand? Honestly it’s probably faster to test it by hand once, but what about when you make a change and have to test again? What about when you want to deploy that artifact to production? What about six months down the line, how do you verify that button still works in each of three deployed environments? Are you going to check them all? What about 80 buttons? \\n\\n\\tLook, for small projects or small teams, you can probably get away without testing to a point. If you’ve got smart people who code carefully, it \\n\\tcan \\n\\twork. You’re not going to see a group of college students doing TDD on a class project. But in the enterprise software world (where we make our money) code will stick around for years, be deployed thousands of times, and worked on by tens or hundreds of people. Once the reliability of a piece of software comes into question, it adds a thousand pound weight to the team that maintains it. \\n\\n\\tHow do we advocate for TDD? \\n\\n\\tTesting Pyramid\\n\\n\\tRed Green Refactor\\n\\n\\tArrange Act Assert\\n\\n\\tStrong Opinions To Be Justified Later Or Not At All\\n\\tAll your tests should run in the pipeline before deploys. \\n\\tYou should never mock library code.\\n\\tYou should never make something public in a class just so you can see it in a test. \\n\\tYou should avoid inheritance in tests. \\n\\tIf you can remove a piece of code, and your tests still pass, delete that code or update your tests.\\n\\tTests should be named in short English sentences. \\n\\tthis_should_be_ThrownInTheTrash\\n\\tYour test suite should optimize single-test readability.\\n\\tCode coverage tools are an anti-pattern.\\n\\tIf your codebase is on fire, and you can only save the tests or the implementation, save the tests.\\n\\n\\tCritical tool to delivering high quality software over time\\n\\tHow we rotate between projects.\\n\\tWhy it is good for us\\n\\tWe want depth in software development not domains\\n\\tExposes ourselves to various points of view\\n\\tGain breadth, learn how to learn\\n\\tDrop in anywhere and be productive\\n\\tKeeps us from getting bored\\n\\tFocusedLabs team cohesion\\n\\tKeeps us from getting stuck\\n\\tShows we have a lot of great people\\n\\tChance for people on the team to take more responsibility \\n\\tMore flexibility during allocation cycles\\n\\tKeeps one project from having all engineers\\n\\tCan go on vacations and turn off email\\n\\tLoosely coupled, highly cohesive \\n\\tWhy it is good for clients\\n\\tMultiple people have context, vacations don\\'t halt work!\\n\\tMakes hand off much easier\\n\\tForces client to not be reliant on Focused Labs\\n\\tMakes the code base easier to hand off\\n\\tPractice onboarding before clients are onboarded\\n\\tMake production support easier\\n\\tKeep the energy level up\\n\\tFlexibility to increase / decrease burn\\n\\tAdds resilience by building in the constant of change\\n\\tImproves the code base\\n\\tProduct can outlast the team\\n\\n\\tGood for everyone!\\n\\tIncreases quality of codebase\\n\\tReduces bus count\\n\\tForces tribal knowledge to be codified\\n\\tReduces dependency on any one person\\n\\tif you love something let it go\\n\\n\\tAnchors\\n\\tContext holder\\n\\tResponsible for the long term success of the project\\n\\tWhy decisions were made?\\n\\tSoft landing for clients as we rotate everyone else\\n\\tNon-dictatorial position\\n\\tFilling gaps\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tAnchors are expected to...\\n\\tKeep leadership informed of the health of their team, client, and project\\n\\t\\tProject status\\n\\t\\tPractices status\\n\\t\\tClient happiness\\n\\t\\tAllocation needs\\n\\t\\tCommunicate upcoming milestones\\n\\t\\tCommunicate risks\\n\\tHave a longer rotation on a project or with a client\\n\\tHelp a team arrive at and stick to our best practices\\n\\tPush the team to continuously improve on practices\\n\\tIf there is no PM, there are additional expectations\\n\\t\\tManage the backlog of work\\n\\t\\tFacilitate IPM\\n\\t\\tEnsure retros/demos are happening\\n\\n\\tWhat is an anchor?\\n\\tAn experienced XP practitioner who can represent how and why we approach building software in the way that we do\\n\\tSomeone who can understand the health of the team, where there is room for improvement, and help the team achieve that improvement\\n\\tSomeone who is generally allocated to a project longer than over developers, in order to maintain context and client relationships\\n\\tSome who can start a new project with a new client\\n\\tKeeping track of technology, leading the tech practice, following best practices\\n\\tMentor -

That it should go one of two ways: get rid of the role entirely, or that it is a full & explicit role \\n\\t\\t\\tDavid: Leans into context, less the technical ability - but keep the context through the project. Report back to leadership. Know when things aren’t aligned & when you can’t \\n\\t\\t\\tRead from the document for the folks that weren’t present\\n\\t\\t\\tCece: The written down role differs from what people are actually doing.  We need to give it a real name & definitions for accountability. PMs have the vision, designers have certain features, there should be more rigor around the role. \\n\\t\\t\\tNew projects moving forward should have a PM, or it’s a very engineering oriented project\\n\\t\\t\\tTravis: Apprehension around using the term lead, what’s that about? \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAustin:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYou don’t have to be the strongest technically\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYou’re mainly bringing experience\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tApplying knowledge in a broader way, decisions can be made at a team level. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt’s a type of conversational mentorship\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCece: you have to be a competent engineer to be a lead, because you’re in front of the client. You don’t have to be the most technical ninja wizard, but it’s a marrying of leadership capabilities. You’re accountable for making sure that architectural conversations are happening. Sometimes that emerges on teams, but sometimes you have to make it happen. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKate: changing the title.  On some teams, changing the title would ruffle features.  (Cece concurs)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAustyn: it could help to position that person higher from the client side, to help them get buy in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat should they be accountable for: \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChris: can’t speak to being an anchor, but what I see: \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOther places, the position we have as anchor is actually two positions elsewhere.  The mentor technically for other people, and the facilitator mentoring, etc. Giving this a role would help clear up assigning these roles as anchor would help us decide which is more important. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBeing a tech lead is difficult if you’re not technically proficient, if you’re responsible for ensuring design meetings, upholding certain programming mindsets, paradigms.  If you can’t quickly assess what’s difficult, you’ll \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBut there’s another role: ensuring your team is coordinated, keeping the backlog clean, making sure you have the right contacts at the company, you have to present a face to the client company. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe technical parts can be offloaded to the team, but the facilitating parts are related as a role. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTravis: it’s interesting to see all the different roles that everyone is actually performing.  The ones around making sure nothing falls through the cracks; sounds like identifying weaknesses, and filling in the cracks to help folks grow in those areas. You may have someone who’s super strong technically, there’s a PM that frequently wants help planning stories, so I spend a lot of time doing that, but another team might need more support on technical aspects. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAustyn: A more junior team has more conversations around how to do things, but having \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCece: the intangibles of filling in, is leadership\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tErin: the structure of the team changes the roles as well.  If you don’t have a DL, PM, etc. you are those things. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTravis: not sustainable long-term, so the role is to delegate and make yourself redundant. If you’re the only person going to meetings, delegate out to other folks. I’m not the only one with context, anyone should be able to \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCece: work on effectiveness, rather than efficient. It’s not sustainable long term, because you can never leave \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChris: Seconding Linden’s take that a fixed description of the anchor as a catch-all causes folks to delegate upward. They start filtering everything through the anchor. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCece: RACI chart, what are folks accountable for. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAustyn, upskill the whole team (like Travis said) make yourself obsolete \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tErin: the “don’t let it fall through the cracks” role + the upskill approach requires better communication as folks take things off of the anchor’s plate.  Sometimes people will branch out and if the anchor isn’t in the loop, they don’t have the full picture. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCece: Let’s pick this up later\\n\\t\\t07.12.22\\n\\t\\t\\tFacilitator: Peter\\n\\t\\t\\tIntro\\n\\t\\t\\tOne word opener \\n\\t\\t\\tFollow-up on any action items\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tHelps\\n\\t\\t\\t“Unfreezing the middle” (example from HM)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAmplifies the stress level\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUpper mgmt champions our practices\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut middle management doesn’t always\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmy way or the highway\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnot listening\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmany teams with different dev strategies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsome are supportive of pairing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tresource constrained\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tworried that consultants have too much context that HM devs don’t have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWe need to learn how to make our practices work for the client’s goals\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAdvocate for the team, not just for yourself\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA delivery lead could help with cross-team comm\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHow does the anchor role factor into this kind of project (with many teams)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIdeas:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAggregate our observations\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMaking sure we are not completely siloed from each other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHow are the non-Focused teams functioning?\\n\\t\\t\\tTopics\\n\\t\\t\\tTalk about the “three questions” from last week (see google doc \\n\\t\\t\\thttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1EbSCegJ8mJS6OfUtYPwTvhGnR75yHQYk8JzCZrQbHLk/edit#heading=h.xq8jftjufupr\\n\\t\\t\\t)\\n\\t\\t\\tAction Items\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t07.05.22\\n\\t\\t\\tFacilitator: Kate\\n\\t\\t\\tIntro\\n\\t\\t\\tOne word opener\\n\\t\\t\\tFollow up on any action items\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHappy Money feedback session went well.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWorked well in gather, but was hard to alert people when it was time to come back to the main room\\n\\t\\t\\tHelps\\n\\t\\t\\tRamping down on a project while another consultant is ramping up.

The purpose is to talk about how the day went, reflect on what went well, and determine if there are ways the pair can collaborate better in the future. It’s a good opportunity to get to know your teammate’s working style and improve your future pairing sessions.\\n\\tWhat should I talk about in a pair retro?\\n\\tTimes throughout the day when you felt things were going really well\\n\\t\\t“I felt like we were really in a groove after lunch - we crushed out that feature and managed to get in that sweet refactoring”\\n\\t\\t“I liked that we took a break when we got stuck on that test - I felt a lot more refreshed coming back, and we were able to get unstuck a lot faster”\\n\\t\\t“Today was really fun!”\\n\\tTimes when you felt like pairing could have been better\\n\\t\\t“When we were working on that story after lunch I felt like we were spinning because neither of us were familiar with Spring Security. Next time I think we should split for a bit and review the docs, so we can understand what’s going on”\\n\\t\\t“I felt a bit behind when we were working on the front end code. Next time I’d like to drive so I can get more familiar with that part of the codebase”\\n\\t\\t“I was really dragging in the middle of the afternoon, sorry if you felt like I wasn’t fully present. I’ll suggest that we take a quick break next time”\\n\\tAny questions you might have for your pair\\n\\t\\t“I’m working on explaining complex technical solutions in a simpler way. Do you have any feedback for me from the meeting earlier when I was explaining that new system?”\\n\\t\\t“How do you feel today went?”\\n\\tFAQs\\n\\tShould pair retros be every day?\\n\\t\\tIdeally, yes! During pair retros, it\\'s essential to engage in meaningful conversations with your pair, even if you feel aren\\'t any significant concerns to address. These conversations provide an excellent opportunity to connect with your pair and allow them to express their thoughts about how the day went. It\\'s a great way to reflect on what went well throughout the day and identify areas where you can improve your collaboration in future pairing sessions. Additionally, these conversations provide insight into your pair’s working style, which can help you understand them better and optimize future pairing sessions. So, it\\'s highly recommended that you take advantage of every pair retro session, even if you don\\'t have any big concerns to address.\\n\\tWhat if I don’t have any critical feedback for my pair?\\n\\t\\tIt\\'s okay to not always have critical feedback! Take a moment to see what could have been improved, but if a pairing session went really well, that\\'s great. There\\'s no need to force feedback just for the sake of finding something to criticize. However, changing your perspective can sometimes be helpful when thinking about feedback. We often think of pair feedback as simply \"critical\", but it can also be a valuable tool for understanding each other\\'s strengths and desires for growth. By doing so, you can optimize your partnership and support your pair in achieving their goals for growth.\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you and your pair were working in the physical world, building a complicated structure and the plans were continuously in flux, and you were collaborating  on a physical task, what worked today and what didn’t work today? If you were building a house, and your pair was holding the hammer while you held the nail, what worked and what didn’t work for the two of you? Would it be better for someone to mark where the nails should go instead, and you use the nail \\n\\t\\t\\tand\\n\\t\\t\\t hammer? Do you want them to demonstrate how they use a different type of tool? Is there anything about how you worked together that could be changed to make things more efficient / fun / engaging / simple?\\n\\n\\tWhat is a Tech Lead at Focused Labs?\\n\\tThe Tech Lead is the technical leader for the Focused Labs developers on a project team. They are a contributing developer to the team with additional responsibilities and authority that is accountable for the technical success of the engagement. The role is a combination of \\n\\ttechnical\\n\\t, \\n\\tconsulting\\n\\t, and \\n\\tleadership\\n\\t skills.\\n\\tTech leads are accountable for:\\n\\tThe technical quality of the software delivered\\n\\tEnsuring that the team is following Focused Labs core development practices\\n\\tConsulting the client organization on the best technical approach\\n\\tMaintaining the technical context of the project and being able to explain the ‘why’s’ behind architectural decisions. \\n\\tThe individual in this role is not solely responsible for accomplishing all of the tasks listed above. Instead, their main responsibility is to guide the team\\'s technical decisions and ensure that ownership is delegated effectively while maintaining accountability for Focus Labs\\'s high standards of execution.\\n\\tThe allocations team determines who the Tech Lead is for a project. This is a project-specific title that a developer holds only for the duration of that project.\\n\\tTechnical\\n\\tThe tech lead should not make decisions alone or hoard all technical project context. Instead, they should work to align the team\\'s technical direction and incorporate feedback from other developers in order to make the strongest technical decisions possible. The tech lead does not need to be an expert in the tech stack or domain when they start a project, but are expected to learn quickly and leverage their team and existing knowledge to make informed decisions.\\n\\tThe tech lead should lead by example and is expected write code and actively participate in development. They should spend at least 80% of their time pairing with the rest of the team. This is critical for preventing knowledge silos, guiding decisions in the codebase, and maintaining a high level of quality.\\n\\tConsulting\\n\\tThe tech lead is not only a technical leader but also a trusted technical partner whom the client seeks out for advice, perspective, and concrete solutions. They should expand their sphere of influence beyond the core team and build relationships with other client teams. This is critical for understanding the client\\'s technical landscape, so that the tech lead can make the best technical decisions based on the client\\'s current position.\\n\\tLeadership\\n\\tLeadership on a team is shared with other roles. The product manager and designer collaborate on \\n\\twhat\\n\\t to build while the tech lead is accountable for \\n\\thow\\n\\t to build. The tech lead guides the team\\'s technical direction, delegates responsibilities effectively, and is accountable for Focused Labs\\'s high standards of execution. They generate consensus when then can, and make decisions when necessary.\\n\\tResponsibilities of the Tech Lead\\n\\tEnsuring that the team is following core Focused Labs dev practices, including always delivering working software, TDD, CI/CD, pairing and pair rotations, managing technical debt, preventing knowledge silos, etc.\\n\\tEnsuring that the product is production-ready by making sure that \\n\\tcross functional\\n\\t requirements are met, including performance, security, scalability, monitoring, logging, documentation, etc.\\n\\tUnderstanding the technical requirements of the product and client, and working closely with  PM and design \\n\\tto ensure \\n\\tthey\\n\\t are prioritized in the backlog\\n\\t supports continuously shipping working software\\n\\tEnsuring architecture decisions fit product and client needs\\n\\tConsulting the client on technical best practices and advocating for XP\\n\\t core practices\\n\\tGrowing their sphere of influence outside of the core team by establishing and maintaining relationships with \\n\\tclient technical teams\\n\\t and enterprise architects, including teams working in the same product area, DevOps, security, etc.\\n\\tCommunicating technical risks, wins, and allocation needs to the Delivery Lead\\n\\tMost Effective Tech Leads…\\n\\tDelegate responsibilities rather than doing everything themselves.\\n\\t Although the Tech Lead is accountable for the success of team initiatives, it is unlikely that they will be able to effectively do everything by themselves. Tech Leads should seek to empower their team by removing obstacles, transferring ownership, and avoiding micromanagement. They use authority tactfully and hold team members accountable.\\n\\tCollaborate closely with their cross-functional peers and client leadership.\\n\\t Success is rarely tied solely to technical outcomes. Effective Tech Leads work with product, design, architecture, and other teams to make informed decisions. They are a technical \\n\\tpartner\\n\\t and make informed decisions in the context of a client’s technical landscape.\\n\\tContribute to a healthy team environment by setting an example.\\n\\t Good leaders seek feedback often to make course corrections. They have a good sense of team morale and promote open communication among team members to proactively prevent interpersonal conflict. They address team issues directly and escalate when necessary.\\n\\tAct as a \\n\\tprimary \\n\\tpoint of contact but not the \\n\\tonly \\n\\tpoint of contact. \\n\\tAn effective Tech Lead manages their time well. They build client relationships while balancing their time as a technical contributor. This means being selective about the meetings that they need to attend and looking for opportunities to volunteer team members in their place.\\n\\tLogistics\\n\\tRole Requirements\\n\\tSenior+ software developer on pathways\\n\\tHas been on at least one previous Focused Labs project\\n\\tTech Lead Rotations\\n\\tTech leads are typically allocated to a project for at least 8+ months (or the duration of the project, if it’s a shorter engagement).\\n\\tLarge (3+ pair) projects and projects that have a tech lead who is scheduled to rotate will have an appointed secondary tech lead. The secondary tech lead will pair with the tech lead, in order to gain context on both the role and on the project.\\n\\tBecoming a Tech Lead for the first time\\n\\tTalk to your manager about your interest in the role\\n\\tBe appointed as a secondary tech lead on a project and shadow the current tech lead\\n\\tSecondary Tech Lead\\n\\tThis role is a specifically appointed developer who is a pair to the current tech lead\\n\\tThe purpose of the role is to:\\n\\t\\tUp skill a new tech lead by giving them the opportunity to learn from an experienced tech lead on a project.\\n\\t\\tTransfer knowledge and context from an existing tech lead when they are scheduled to  rotate off of a project.\\n\\n\\tFuture Ideas & Next Steps\\n\\t\\tGuidelines and metrics around measuring the technical success of engagements\\n\\t\\tAdditional tech lead training\\n\\n\\n\\nEngineering Events\\n\\n\\t(formally Engineering Focused Lunches)\\n\\n\\tThe CCC currently meets every Monday at 12:30 CT\\n\\tWhat is the CCC?\\n\\tAn engineering focused lunch is dedicated time to discuss technical engineering problems\\n\\tMinimum pre work required!

Right now we use an almost exact replica of an interview from a previous company. It's important that we understand why we replicated this interview and what the goal is.\\nWe use this exercise as our first interview because it is objective, repeatable, canned, and has a consistent scoring system. The exercise tests a candidate's ability to implement an object oriented solution, test drive that solution, communicate about the code in that solution, and be empathetic to the boundaries we set. This interview is a great way to get a quick leading indicator of success and is a lot of fun!\\nWho should consider learning the TPI?\\nA developer who is excellent at TDD and Pairing, and can demonstrate the value of these practices to a candidate who might not be familiar with them\\nSomeone who is comfortable and confident in their ability to accurately and quickly make a determination on weather a candidate is worth investing in a full day interview\\nSomeone who has the time and willingness to learn the exercise - it typically takes between 15 - 20 hours to be fully onboarded and ready to run TPIs on your own!\\nProcess\\nReach out to a current screener to kick off the process.

That it should go one of two ways: get rid of the role entirely, or that it is a full & explicit role \\n\\t\\tDavid: Leans into context, less the technical ability - but keep the context through the project. Report back to leadership. Know when things aren’t aligned & when you can’t \\n\\t\\tRead from the document for the folks that weren’t present\\n\\t\\tCece: The written down role differs from what people are actually doing.  We need to give it a real name & definitions for accountability. PMs have the vision, designers have certain features, there should be more rigor around the role. \\n\\t\\tNew projects moving forward should have a PM, or it’s a very engineering oriented project\\n\\t\\tTravis: Apprehension around using the term lead, what’s that about? \\n\\t\\t\\tAustin:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYou don’t have to be the strongest technically\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYou’re mainly bringing experience\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tApplying knowledge in a broader way, decisions can be made at a team level. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt’s a type of conversational mentorship\\n\\t\\t\\tCece: you have to be a competent engineer to be a lead, because you’re in front of the client. You don’t have to be the most technical ninja wizard, but it’s a marrying of leadership capabilities. You’re accountable for making sure that architectural conversations are happening. Sometimes that emerges on teams, but sometimes you have to make it happen. \\n\\t\\t\\tKate: changing the title.  On some teams, changing the title would ruffle features.  (Cece concurs)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAustyn: it could help to position that person higher from the client side, to help them get buy in\\n\\t\\t\\tWhat should they be accountable for: \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tChris: can’t speak to being an anchor, but what I see: \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOther places, the position we have as anchor is actually two positions elsewhere.  The mentor technically for other people, and the facilitator mentoring, etc. Giving this a role would help clear up assigning these roles as anchor would help us decide which is more important. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBeing a tech lead is difficult if you’re not technically proficient, if you’re responsible for ensuring design meetings, upholding certain programming mindsets, paradigms.  If you can’t quickly assess what’s difficult, you’ll \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBut there’s another role: ensuring your team is coordinated, keeping the backlog clean, making sure you have the right contacts at the company, you have to present a face to the client company. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe technical parts can be offloaded to the team, but the facilitating parts are related as a role. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTravis: it’s interesting to see all the different roles that everyone is actually performing.  The ones around making sure nothing falls through the cracks; sounds like identifying weaknesses, and filling in the cracks to help folks grow in those areas. You may have someone who’s super strong technically, there’s a PM that frequently wants help planning stories, so I spend a lot of time doing that, but another team might need more support on technical aspects. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAustyn: A more junior team has more conversations around how to do things, but having \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCece: the intangibles of filling in, is leadership\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tErin: the structure of the team changes the roles as well.  If you don’t have a DL, PM, etc. you are those things. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTravis: not sustainable long-term, so the role is to delegate and make yourself redundant. If you’re the only person going to meetings, delegate out to other folks. I’m not the only one with context, anyone should be able to \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCece: work on effectiveness, rather than efficient. It’s not sustainable long term, because you can never leave \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tChris: Seconding Linden’s take that a fixed description of the anchor as a catch-all causes folks to delegate upward. They start filtering everything through the anchor. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCece: RACI chart, what are folks accountable for. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAustyn, upskill the whole team (like Travis said) make yourself obsolete \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tErin: the “don’t let it fall through the cracks” role + the upskill approach requires better communication as folks take things off of the anchor’s plate.  Sometimes people will branch out and if the anchor isn’t in the loop, they don’t have the full picture. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCece: Let’s pick this up later\\n\\t07.12.22\\n\\t\\tFacilitator: Peter\\n\\t\\tIntro\\n\\t\\tOne word opener \\n\\t\\tFollow-up on any action items\\n\\n\\t\\tHelps\\n\\t\\t“Unfreezing the middle” (example from HM)\\n\\t\\t\\tAmplifies the stress level\\n\\t\\t\\tUpper mgmt champions our practices\\n\\t\\t\\tBut middle management doesn’t always\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmy way or the highway\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot listening\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmany teams with different dev strategies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsome are supportive of pairing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresource constrained\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworried that consultants have too much context that HM devs don’t have\\n\\t\\t\\tWe need to learn how to make our practices work for the client’s goals\\n\\t\\t\\tAdvocate for the team, not just for yourself\\n\\t\\t\\tA delivery lead could help with cross-team comm\\n\\t\\t\\tHow does the anchor role factor into this kind of project (with many teams)\\n\\t\\t\\tIdeas:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAggregate our observations\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMaking sure we are not completely siloed from each other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHow are the non-Focused teams functioning?\\n\\t\\tTopics\\n\\t\\tTalk about the “three questions” from last week (see google doc \\n\\t\\thttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1EbSCegJ8mJS6OfUtYPwTvhGnR75yHQYk8JzCZrQbHLk/edit#heading=h.xq8jftjufupr\\n\\t\\t)\\n\\t\\tAction Items\\n\\n\\n\\t07.05.22\\n\\t\\tFacilitator: Kate\\n\\t\\tIntro\\n\\t\\tOne word opener\\n\\t\\tFollow up on any action items\\n\\t\\t\\tHappy Money feedback session went well.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWorked well in gather, but was hard to alert people when it was time to come back to the main room\\n\\t\\tHelps\\n\\t\\tRamping down on a project while another consultant is ramping up.

Manufacturing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFocused on Delivery: Replaced legacy manual spreadsheet process with software that was scalable for BTR Energy and clients. Software manages and records charging events for over 100,000 electric vehicles (EV), while also automating reporting to a California regulator and to BTR Energy’s clients. Built and deployed a client-facing application for streamlining onboarding with BTR Energy’s Bridge platform and the management of EV charging data.\\nFocused on Results: Software propelled BTR Energy’s evolution from a software-enabled services company to a software-first product company for EV manufacturers and others.\\nFocused on Partnership: Focused Labs was trusted to serve as the technology arm of BTR Energy and has helped foster direct client relationships to build business-critical software. Developers at Focused Labs have become an integral part of BTR Energy’s success and growth over the last year.\\nAgile workflow enabled startup BTR Energy to automate workflows\\nBTR Energy launched in 2019 to provide a platform that automates participation in low carbon fuels programs, like California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS). BTR Energy’s platform connects EV manufacturers, fleet operators, and charging station networks to renewable electricity producers in order to generate LCFS “credits”. Together, BTR Energy and its clients use charging data from EVs to make quarterly submissions to the California Air Resources Board and to generate LCFS credits. These credits can be sold, generating revenue for BTR Energy and its clients. BTR Energy keeps a small percentage of this revenue, providing the majority to the EV manufacturers, fleet operators, or charging station networks, and the renewable electricity producers.\\nInitially, BTR Energy managed all of its data in spreadsheets, but its platform now collects near real-time EV charging data and automatically processes that data and creates the reports necessary to generate LCFS credits, making it possible to manage a much larger amount of data from more and more diverse clients.\\nThe engagement between BTR Energy and Focused Labs started in early 2020. Focused Labs started by automating small parts of the manual spreadsheet based solution BTR Energy was using. BTR Energy understood that this legacy system would not be scalable and would not be able to meet the needs of its clients. As such, Focused Labs set out to build a better way to manage the data, improving and automating and BTR Energy’s engagements with its clients.\\nOpportunity to evolve and grow BTR Energy’s capabilities\\nBTR Energy needed scalable ways to catalog, analyze and share large amounts of charging data between EV manufacturers and regulators, while also preserving consumer privacy and a high … of data protection. Spreadsheets could not serve the business, so Focused Labs built the BTR Energy “Bridge” platform, which includes direct integrations with its clients. This makes the transmission of EV charging data much more seamless for both BTR Energy and its clients.\\nBTR Bridge Platform\\n\\nCreated a React and Spring Boot-based application to:\\n\\nManage a fleet of over 100,000 electric vehicles (EVs)\\nRecord charging events for the EV fleet\\nGenerate quarterly registration and charging submissions for a California regulatory program, the Low Carbon Fuel Standard\\n\\n\\nCaptured over 8 million unique charging events from 4 different vehicle manufacturers.\\nImplemented a PostGIS-backed geo-filtering system that allows performant filtering of hundreds of thousands of charging events against 30,000 public charging stations in California.\\n\\nHaving an app to manage such a large amount of vehicle data and automating its delivery to the relevant regulator made it a valuable asset to both BTR Energy and their clients.\\nSince the development and deployment of the Bridge platform, BTR Energy has shifted from a software-enabled services business to a software-centric company.\\n\\n\\n“The software became the business,” says Jack Barrow, CEO of BTR Energy.\\n\\n\\nTrusting Focused Labs to meet directly with BTR Energy’s clients\\nOnce the BTR Bridge Platform was deployed, BTR Energy needed a technology-forward strategy with its clients. Barrow and his partners at BTR Energy trusted Focused Labs’ technology and people so much that they brought them to collaborative meetings with clients and prospects interested in integrating with BTR Energy’s software. At the time, BTR Energy did not have a full in-house technology team, so Focused Labs developers took on that role.\\nTrusting an outside company to meet with your clients (especially when the potential client pool is relatively small) is not a role Focused Labs took lightly. “We were looking for technical talent, but also people with the ability to maintain a relationship — and we absolutely got that from Focused Labs,” Barrow says. “We took [Focused Labs co-founders] Austin and Luke to Michigan to meet with one of our largest clients, and they just hit it off with everyone. I think it was helpful for BTR Energy’s credibility.”\\nBTR Energy’s trust in Focused Labs continues. Two developers from Focused Labs directly work with BTR Energy’s client tech teams to address and manage business needs as they arrive. In addition to fielding the needs of client tech teams, a core responsibility of the Focused Labs team has been the constant improvement of BTR Energy’s security posture. For each integration, a robust security review is conducted by BTR Energy’s clients. BTR Energy trusts Focused Labs to field these reviews and strengthen their security with each subsequent one; BTR Energy is now compliant with hundreds of specific security requirements imposed on it by its clients.\\nFinally, BTR Energy relied on the Focused Labs team to demonstrate the software’s capabilities to investors during a funding round in August 2021. This demonstration ultimately helped BTR secure those funds and advance the company forward.\\n\\n\\n“Client and investor presentations are important moments for an early-stage company like BTR Energy. Just as Austin and Luke had made a positive impression on our clients in 2020, Focused Labs engineers made a positive impression on investors in 2021. Enthusiasm for BTR Energy noticeably grew after the presentations, and both investors that met the Focused Labs team ultimately participated in BTR Energy’ Series A, a testament, in part, to the quality of the software and the presentations.”\\n\\n\\nBuilding a client-facing app for enhanced experience\\nInitially, the Bridge platform primarily supported work within BTR Energy — it was more functional than pretty. Once the business grew to work with automakers and their APIs, a client-facing friendly dashboard needed to be built. Focused Labs and BTR Energy collaborated to make and deploy a version of the Bridge platform for its clients.\\nThe Bridge For Clients\\nFocused Labs developers and BTR Energy worked together to:\\n\\nBuild a standardized REST API to allow BTR Energy to scale and onboard new clients faster (3 new clients since Summer 2020).\\nIterated on client platform in Spring 2021 to allow BTR to onboard client with new types of electric equipment (charging stations).\\nBuild and deploy a client-facing dashboard between March and June 2021 to allow clients new visibility into their charging data and the resulting LCFS credits.\\nConducted a thorough demo to potential investors in August 2021 to demonstrate the software’s capabilities during a funding round.\\nPlanned and executed a deployment infrastructure migration to improve BTR Energy’s security posture and technological independence in October 2021\\n\\nMaking integrations as easy as possible from the client side is paramount to BTR Energy’s business plan. The easier it is for an automaker or other clients to directly onboard with BTR Energy’s applications, the smoother the business relationship will be.\\nThe culture of Focused Labs will be the future of BTR Energy software\\nBTR Energy has grown significantly during its engagement with Focused Labs. As BTR Energy adapted to client needs, Focused Labs has been there to provide the technology and expertise needed for growth within tight timeframes. Eventually, BTR Energy will hire its own internal software development team, but the standards for building business changing software and doing so quickly will stand as the minimum. Focused Labs’ core practices of pair programming, CI/CD, and test-driven development have laid a foundation that future BTR Energy developers can build on in the years to come.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n433

Developed software to build a last-mile delivery market.\\nFocused on Results: In the first 3 months of using the mobile app, the recovery of numerous stolen vehicles saved the company hundreds of thousands in inventory. The last-mile delivery app contributed to Hertz’s bottom-line increase in revenue.\\nFocused on Partnership: Focused Labs built and deployed numerous applications with quick turnaround times — showing the developers at Hertz that technology solutions can be fast, functional, and profitable. Focused Labs took a very enablement-centric approach during the development process. Although Hertz had a very capable engineering team, they relied on Focused Labs to bring new, impactful, and sustainable engineering practices into their organization.\\nHelping Hertz Leverage Technology To Capture New Markets\\nDiversifying lines of business is one of the best ways to leverage technology within a company. More and more, technology and outside forces are shaping industries in new, quick ways that can make age-old businesses feel like they are in a constant state of flux. For instance, car rental giant Hertz and similar companies were upended as the pandemic shut down almost all global travel and put the need to rent cars at a standstill. Technology has helped Hertz rebound and opens up new lines of business while also finding solutions to old problems. But they didn’t always have the technology infrastructure to respond proactively to these issues.\\nHertz hired Opal Perry as Global CIO — to rebuild a technology-forward culture that would see digital solutions as a way to grow new business and not just a functional necessity.\\nIn the past, Hertz had outsourced a lot of its technology needs to external vendors. While it was functional for the ways technology had previously served Hertz, using outside vendors left their technology arm with a lack of innovation. An agile technology team within a business can know the pain points and work to fix them swiftly. Putting the innovation needs of a business into a third party is hard if you want to move quickly.\\nPerry needed to build up a technology team at Hertz that could be proactive in finding new solutions to their fast-paced business problems.\\nThat’s why she hired Focused Labs.\\nNavigating a culture and technology transformation\\nFocused Labs’ work with Hertz started in January of 2020. The company had been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic that globally put all travel to a standstill. Hertz needed to build technological solutions to pivot their business to encompass new ventures that could live outside of the usual model of renting cars direct to consumers.\\nTo do that, Hertz also needed to change the development culture. This transformation could leverage technology to discover new lines of business or improve older ways of working.\\n“We wanted fast help to get the work done,” says Perry, “but also to embed the culture and ways of working that we want to be our target state.”\\nTwo Focused Labs developers paired with two members of the Hertz RevLab team to get to work. By working directly alongside team members of Hertz, they were able to learn the kinds of methods and curiosity Focused Labs keeps top of mind when developing a new piece of software.\\nBuilding a more durable business with technology solutions\\nWork between Focused Labs developers and the Hertz RevLab in Bannockburn, IL started with finding out what business opportunities currently exist and could exist in the future. They were looking for ways that technology could pivot to new business lines and software to support that business line could be built and deployed. The quicker a business can adjust to a market in flux, the more durable that business can become in the long term.\\nSVU: Stolen Vehicles Unit\\nThe initial engagement between Hertz and Focused Labs started with a discovery process to identify areas in which Hertz may be underutilizing their existing vehicles. Through this process, they found that substantial time was being lost within the organization due to vehicle theft. It was time-consuming to identify a vehicle had been stolen and the longer the vehicle went undetected as stolen, the less likely it was to be returned.\\nHertz RevLab and Focused Labs embarked on a project called SVU (stolen vehicles unit). The teams built and deployed a mobile application that allows the Hertz recovery team to detect, track and recover stolen vehicles. So far it has been wildly successful. In the first 3 months of use, numerous stolen Hertz vehicles were recovered — which saved the company hundreds of thousands of dollars in inventory.\\nWorking with stakeholders inside Hertz, including the executive team, helped Focused Labs to scope, shape, and prioritize the way software was ideated, built, and deployed into use.\\nTNC: Transportation Network Company\\nOne of the business lines outside of Hertz\\'s standard consumer rentals is TNC — a program that rents vehicles to Uber and Lyft rideshare drivers. Often someone will decide against buying another vehicle or using their own in favor of renting a vehicle to drive customers where they need to go. Uber and Lyft are both technology-forward companies with everything necessary to their business living within an app on the driver and rider’s phones. Hertz needed a similarly easy-to-use portal for TNC partners to access all of the necessary compliance documents that come with standard rideshare agreements.\\nBeing able to adjust to the needs of fast-paced markets like ridesharing is a big benefit to doing this work in an agile way. “We’re no more than a week away from making a change in the iteration planning process. We’ve gained speed-to-market and agility,” says Brandon Mendoza, VP of Hertz’s Transportation Network Company. “Now we’re never a week away from making a material change to our strategy.”\\n\\n\\n“We’re no more than a week away from making a change in the iteration planning process. We’ve gained speed-to-market and agility,” says Brandon Mendoza, VP of Hertz’s Transportation Network Company.\\n\\n\\nGaining new revenue streams for Hertz with last-mile delivery\\nAs the pandemic cut down on vehicle rentals, Hertz had to develop new ways to use the existing fleets of vehicles and staff still on hand. There was an opportunity in the fact that delivery services were booming as so many people were no longer doing their shopping in person.\\nMaking tens of thousands of software-enabled deliveries within retail shipping\\nIn less than 3 weeks, Focused Labs and Hertz developers built an initial dispatching system to fulfill a new market for Hertz — last-mile delivery. A retail partner hired Hertz to finish off deliveries they needed to reach their customers. This opened the door for Focused Labs to help develop that software.\\nFrom July - November 2020:\\n\\nThe dispatching system was iterated and improved upon\\nFocused Labs built a mobile application to support both delivery drivers and deliver customers package insights\\nFocused Labs built an invoicing system so Hertz could automate billing their retail partners using this new service.\\n\\nThese pieces of software-enabled Hertz to provide the retailer with the capability to reach a broader customer delivery base. Hertz generated revenue that would not have been able to happen without quick technology solutions.\\nIncreased revenue captured via logistics\\nHertz leveraged its logistics partnerships to fulfill last-mile deliveries. Focused Labs helped lead the team in building the software to make this highly profitable venture feasible.\\nIn a short time-frame Hertz and Focused Labs:\\n\\nBuilt and deployed a React Native mobile application to the Google Play store in 2 weeks.\\nBuilt a backend API and integration with a partner to enable delivery manifests to automatically deploy to the app.\\nProvided support for partner last-mile deliveries.\\n\\nThis extremely quick app deployment helped Hertz and its partner realize a material increase in package deliveries and generated a new stream of revenue. These quick turnarounds for such large deliverables proved out the methods of Focused Labs.\\nChanging the future of Hertz technology\\nThe deliverables in these quickly turned around projects is undeniable, which is why the partnership between Focused Labs and Hertz is still going. The number of Focused Labs developers engaged has increased to ten, to cover more ground in building and embedding culture. Thanks to Focused Labs’ enablement approach, Hertz is steadily evolving its technology culture to be a place where the kind of agile developers who can deliver the best technology will want to work.\\nIn hiring Focused Labs, Hertz not only gained agility and flexibility but also learned new engineering practices. Focused Labs helped show Hertz developers the kind of autonomy and confidence needed to build the right piece of software for right now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\nPlease leave your contact information for more details about your project\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n

development was the direction they wanted to pursue. When a few software development contractors decided not to renew their work before finishing a project for Aperture’s client, Troy Anderson, chief production and information officer, saw an opportunity to partner with Focused Labs. He wanted to both finish a project in a time crunch and extend the working relationships to guide his team toward a more agile way of developing software.\\nAperture Health delivers provider management software for companies all across the healthcare space. Anderson’s goal in working with Focused Labs was to enhance his team’s ability to build and deploy complex, specific and impressive software to their clients.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFocused on Delivery\\n\\nFocused Labs developers accelerated product delivery for one of Aperture’s largest clients.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFocused on Results\\n\\nFocused Labs quickly saved a time-sensitive project abandoned by previous development contractors.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFocused on Partnership\\n\\nAperture partnered with Focused Labs to imbue agile work states within their engineering teams.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFocused on Delivery: Focused Labs developers accelerated product delivery for one of Aperture’s largest clients, while building a primary source verification (PSV) API to enable verification and credentialing. During these projects, Focused Labs enabled Aperture’s team with the benefits of Extreme Programming.\\nFocused on Results: Quickly saved a time-sensitive project abandoned by previous development contractors. The PSV API made verification possible within hours instead of weeks. Aperture’s engineers have embraced more pair programming work and significantly improved the daily working relationships between Aperture and client stakeholders.\\nFocused on Partnership: Aperture partnered with Focused Labs to imbue agile work states within their engineering teams while also quickly building software for a client. This will give Aperture a more agile approach to building and deploying valuable software going forward.\\nGuiding an agile Transformation for Aperture’s Development Team\\nAperture Health wanted to work smarter — an agile transformation in product and software development was the direction they wanted to pursue. When a few software development contractors decided not to renew their work before finishing a project for Aperture’s client, Troy Anderson, chief production and information officer, saw an opportunity to partner with Focused Labs. He wanted to both finish a project in a time crunch and extend the working relationships to guide his team toward a more agile way of developing software.\\nAperture Health delivers provider management software for companies all across the healthcare space. Anderson’s goal in working with Focused Labs was to enhance his team’s ability to build and deploy complex, specific and impressive software to their clients.\\nBuilding time-saving healthcare API’s ahead of schedule\\nThe first development project between Aperture and Focused Labs started in December of 2020. The previous team of developers had ended their contract before finishing the job, so understanding the work and its context was the biggest issue in getting started.\\nThe project needed to be finished quickly and Focused Labs was up for the challenge. “Having partners who can quickly staff up like Focused is nice to have,” says Will Reed, former head of engineering at Aperture. “They basically hopped onto a speeding train from a standstill.”\\nAperture needed Focused Labs to help build out a primary source verification (PSV) API for a client. PSV is the method a healthcare provider uses to verify someone has the right certificate, license or registration to practice a profession. This important piece of Aperture client’s work was taking weeks to accomplish due to lack of automation in sharing that data.\\nFocused Labs quickly built a self-service API that enabled Aperture’s client to accomplish PSV within hours —not days. By automating the data retrieval process between accreditor and provider, this software cut PSV requests — which could manually take more than three days — down to four hours. They further streamlined the process by then developing automated billing and invoicing for the API clients.\\nAnd they delivered it all three weeks ahead of schedule.\\nProving the benefits of an agile transformation through pair programming\\nDuring this project, Focused Labs’ developers worked alongside Aperture’s to show the benefits of pair programming. Aperture wanted to move away from a waterfall type workflow to more iterative development. Focused Labs showed Aperture’s team the benefits of things like weekly team rituals and a cadenced release schedule for a project in progress.\\nFocused Labs also collaborated with Aperture to bring more modern tooling into their work environment. When partnering with development teams, Focused Labs always looks to implement new modern systems. With Aperture, the legacy applications they were previously working with made it virtually impossible to find out when the software Aperture was providing to its clients was faltering. To close that feedback loop between Aperture’s clients and Aperture, Focused Labs suggested and then implemented new tooling — such as New Relic — to facilitate performance monitoring. This way the client did not need to alert developers when things were breaking — they now had the tools to monitor performance themselves.\\nThrough working in a more collaborative, agile process, Aperture was able to solve problems in smaller chunks which led to a greater end result. Focused Labs also worked directly with Aperture’s client development team to mend the communication and relationship that had been strained by the contractors who left the project unfinished. This direct communication and collaboration has led to significant improvement in workflow and understanding between Aperture and their client stakeholders.\\nMaking an agile transition away from top-down workflow\\nAperture could have used any other development partner, but what was appealing about Focused Labs was the culture and workflow they were able to model with Aperture’s team.\\n\\n\\nFocused Labs are educators and modelers of new behaviors and new practices.\\nOur team brought the knowledge of the tech stack and Focused Labs were bringing tools in terms of how to work and how to gain confidence about the software that is being built. Everyone’s adding value from day one,” says Reed. “Focused Labs are transferring their process to us and their job is to get out of here.”\\n\\n\\nFocused Labs embodied the best ways to produce valuable software to Aperture’s clients and worked alongside them to ensure they knew it was possible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\nPlease

Systems\\n\\n\\nIndustry\\nWellness\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Focused Labs is hands down the best in the business. From their top notch team to seamless process, they helped to optimize our business backend operations and web experience for our clients. Before working with Focused Labs, we managed many of our systems manually, taking valuable human capital away from our customers. Now our systems are automated, allowing us to put our focus back on our customers. I couldn\\'t recommend anyone more highly than the Focused Labs team.”\\nCaitlyn Fagan, Chief Operating Officer at Inner Matrix Systems\\n\\n\\nAbout\\nInner Matrix System (IMS) is a personal development company that aims to help clients create a meaningful and fulfilling life. Founded by Joey Klein, the program engages clients with guided meditations, 1:1 training, and weekend events.\\nProblem Space\\nEven before the pandemic, IMS had been looking to modernize their digital experiences, which were outdated and not user friendly. Users wanted an easier experience when registering for events, accessing digital materials and viewing upcoming programs and events. The business wanted to create a more professional digital presence, update their programming platform, and scale offerings. With the onset of COVID, it was the perfect opportunity, and business critical, to improve their technology.\\nSolution\\nUsing an iterative approach, the Focused Labs team built and modernized IMS’s new digital presence in phases, which included website rebuilds, a mobile app, updated backend services, and content migration.\\nPhase I\\n\\nRebuild the existing Inner Matrix Group (IMG) and Inner Matrix System (IMS) websites. Automate registration for events and programs to reduce admin hours spent manually registering members. Create a self-registration flow for members, and a trainer portal for trainers and apprentices to manage courses and payments.\\n\\nPhase II\\n\\nMigrate digital and audio visual content from Wordpress to EKS with a Vue and Rails backend to provide greater flexibility in how content can be accessed. Deprecate legacy systems.\\n\\nPhase III\\n\\nCreate a mobile app that allows community members to engage with IMS content offline and on the go. Build a membership registration flow that provides unique access and pricing to IMS content and programs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was easy to navigate! Loved the FAQ section with the dropdown boxes. Everything was very clear and easy to understand! Thank you for all the effort to make this a wonderful tool for changing lives.\"\\nIMS Customer\\n\\n\\nApproach\\nOur team at Focused started each phase of work with a scoping session, to map out and understand what we were building. Then, we built out a backlog to sustain the team for a few weeks and got to work. On Mondays, we kicked off the week with an iterative planning meeting. In this hour, we talked about immediate priorities, asked questions about business processes that impacted features, and discussed any challenges. Other weekly rituals for the team included morning standups and a weekly retro.\\nDuring each phase, we partnered closely with the IMS team and subject matter experts.
