The author highlights the limitations and challenges posed by chatbot interfaces:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLack of affordances:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Chatbot interfaces, typically represented by text inputs, lack clear instructions on how to use them effectively. Unlike physical tools like gloves that have clear indications of their purpose, chatbot interfaces provide minimal guidance, forcing users to figure out how to interact with them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tContextual limitations: \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLanguage models make it easy to send text and receive text responses, but this simplicity leads to challenges in providing necessary context. Users are responsible for providing all the relevant information and instructions, which can be cumbersome and prone to errors.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIsolated responses: \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChatbot interfaces often fail to provide a clear understanding of the changes made in response to user input. Comparing different responses requires scrolling back and forth, making it difficult to identify specific modifications.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tImplementation and evaluation loop:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t The constant switching between asking questions and reading responses disrupts the flow of interaction. Users are required to stop frequently to evaluate the responses, hindering the seamless workflow.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAvoiding \"No man\\'s land\": \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFully automating tasks using chatbots leaves users in a state where they are still required to make decisions, but lack control over the final outcome. The article argues for striking a balance between human input and machine automation to empower users and maintain a sense of craftsmanship.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEmbracing human abilities:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Rather than focusing solely on content generation, the author suggests building AI tools that enhance human capabilities, such as providing suggestions for clearer thinking, manipulating language like sculpting clay, and leveraging AI models to manipulate objects in videos.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe author concludes by advocating for the development of AI tools that incorporate controls, information, and affordances, and empower users by embracing their human abilities.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNatural language is the lazy user interface\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe article titled \"Natural language is the lazy user interface\" discusses the limitations of relying solely on natural language interfaces, such as chatbots, for user interaction with software. While large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have gained significant attention and are expected to revolutionize the technology industry, the article argues that placing the burden on users to formulate precise questions and make sense of responses is inefficient.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe author emphasizes the importance of a good user interface that allows iterative exploration and offers guidance and nudges to users. While natural language interfaces can play a role in assisting users, they should not be the sole or primary interface option. Instead, the potential of LLMs extends beyond natural language interfaces.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe article suggests alternative ways to leverage LLMs, such as using contextual information to preemptively suggest actions, adapting toolbars to specific tasks, enabling dynamic dialog boxes, providing explanations based on screen regions, identifying misunderstandings, offering relevant examples, and tailoring tutorials to individual preferences.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn summary, the article encourages moving beyond exclusive reliance on natural language interfaces and exploring the broader potential of LLMs to enhance user experiences through adaptive and context-aware interfaces.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLanguage Model Sketchbook, or Why I Hate Chatbots\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe article titled \"Language Model Sketchbook, or Why I Hate Chatbots\" explores alternative interfaces and interactions with language models beyond chatbots. The author discusses their curiosity about the epistemic capabilities of language models, viewing them as tools for querying, brainstorming, and enhancing critical thinking.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhile acknowledging the usefulness of chatbots, the author criticizes them as the default and lazy solution for interacting with language models. Instead, they propose exploring non-chatbot interfaces that leverage the unique capabilities of these models.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe article presents several interface sketches as examples. One concept involves \"daemons,\" background characters in a writing environment that provide suggestions, play devil\\'s advocate, synthesize ideas, or fetch research. Another concept called \"Branches\" focuses on exploring cause-and-effect chains by using language models to suggest potential connections. Lastly, \"Epi\" is a general-purpose reasoning assistant for research and non-fiction writing, offering features such as rephrasing sentences, critiquing ideas, finding evidence, generating research questions, and highlighting assumptions through a right-click context menu.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOverall, the article advocates for moving beyond chatbot interfaces and exploring innovative ways to interact with language models that go beyond simple text-based exchanges.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tGoal\\n\\t\\t\\tMan v machine: the AI responds with the same nuance that an SME would\\n\\t\\t\\tFL Logo - be spinning and be an orb (alive)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuick Chat, Grammarly - floating on your screen - type and give you suggestions\\n\\t\\tDesigns\\n\\n\\t\\tScratch pad\\n\\t\\t\\tWhat is FL notion currently used for?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHow can AI make this better?\\n\\t\\t\\t[Enterprise knowledge is] bulky and heavy.

Options are:\\n\\t\\t\\t1. One option is to use the API provided by OpenAI. The terms of service clearly state that the content provided by the user is not used to improve their services, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential. (Source:\\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\tOpenAI\\n\\t\\t\\t).\\n\\t\\t\\t2. Another option is to host ChatGPT on the company\\'s Microsoft Azure servers, which offers out-of-the-box solutions that are both secure and cost-effective. (Source:\\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\tMicrosoft\\n\\t\\t\\t)\\n\\t\\t\\t3. Finally, self-hosting an LLM can be an expensive solution, but it allows organizations to maintain full control over their data. Before proceeding with this option, a security assessment should be conducted, and the NCSC\\'s principles for the security of machine learning should be consulted.\\n\\t\\t\\tHugging Face \\n\\t\\t\\thttps://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=conversational&sort=downloads\\n\\t\\t\\tThere are all sorts of models we can use from Hugging Face. Needing to determine the type of model is pretty important. Some items can be self-hosted for business purposes and others can only be used for academic purposes. Filtering on model type and license should help with this. Besides the number of downloads, I’m not really sure how to assess the models. If they are in the chatbot arena you can find details \\n\\t\\t\\there\\n\\t\\t\\t for scoring.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnother thing to look out for is many of the models chosen here are NOT tuned to be harmless and safe. These are the types of things ChatGPT did so that we wouldn’t have to. There are other models that have as well.\\n\\t\\t\\tSelf Hosting\\n\\t\\t\\tSmaller models are easier to host. By smaller I mean the dataset originally fed to the model is smaller. You can usually tell this by the model name if it has numbers following it. For instance, Llama-7B was trained on a 7 billion data point set. Llama-13B is with 13 billion data points. The more data points means it’ll be more accurate \\n\\t\\t\\tHOWEVER\\n\\t\\t\\t it will cost more to run.\\n\\t\\t\\tRunning Locally\\n\\t\\t\\tA good article for running an LLM locally can be found \\n\\t\\t\\there\\n\\t\\t\\t.\\n\\t\\t\\tRunning locally on a laptop will also have its own set of requirements. I think if we use a smaller model we should be fine on a Macbook, but I’m not 100% sure of that due to \\n\\t\\t\\tthis article\\n\\t\\t\\t. Depending on the model we might have specific hardware/os requirements. \\n\\t\\t\\tRunning locally should not be a long-term solution and we should look at how to get out of it quickly.\\n\\t\\t\\tRunning in the cloud\\n\\t\\t\\tA good discussion about what it might take to host a large model is \\n\\t\\t\\there\\n\\t\\t\\t.

There are other APIs besides openAI that might be cheaper, but we would need to do more investigation if we decide on that route. However, this is the route where privacy might be compromised so we’ll need to look carefully at the companies hosting APIs.\\n\\t\\t\\tModels\\n\\t\\t\\tThis is definitely not an exhaustive list, but it’s a place to start.\\n\\t\\t\\tLamini-LM \\n\\t\\t\\tis literally built to solve this problem.

We’ll need a place to put the model for self-hosting which probably means we’ll need to scope out cloud solutions. \\n\\t\\t\\tWhat are the rough steps or processes involved in creating a Knowledge Hub?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPick a model. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDetermine if it is available for commercial use. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDetermine the accuracy of the model and if it was appropriately tuned for what we need. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDetermine if the model has safeguards already placed around it. Most of the hugging face models have a pro/con list that can help determine if the model is appropriate for us.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDetermine if the model can interpret code well (this is probably a big one we need to figure out).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFind a place to put our model. This will entail looking at hosting services that cater to LLM hosting as well as utilizing GPUs for processing. Each of the big hosting companies could offer multiple solutions, we’ll just have to determine what is right for us.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tExamples: Azure w/ openAI, AWS SageMaker\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tStart to feed it data. The rest of the steps that follow will be just like we’ve been doing with our current experiments with openAI.\\n\\t\\t\\tUpdating the database with new documents is probably going to depend on the technology we decide to use. \\n\\t\\t\\tMost databases allow you to add to an index and persist the new index. Then the vectors and embeddings will be updated. That process is highly dependent on what technology we end up choosing: \\n\\t\\t\\tFor some, we won’t need to worry about tokenizing and doing new embeddings on the new data because it’ll occur automatically.\\n\\t\\t\\tFor others, the process will be more complicated and manual.\\n\\t\\t\\tHow Often to Update? Costs?\\n\\t\\t\\tI think the bigger concern here is figuring out how often to run these types of jobs. These new indexes can be very expensive to update if we’re using a model like openAI. Doing updates will probably be the most expensive part of the process apart from the initial setup of data.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe would most likely want to run custom scripts as a job at an interval specified by the client. How often we run these jobs depends on what the client expects the costs for their new LLM to be. Costs can be occurred by:\\n\\t\\t\\tSelf-hosting - the processing power to create new indexes is GPU time that will need to be paid for. \\n\\t\\t\\tAPI - the usage fees will be very high for that time period as we’ll be using a lot of tokens at once.\\n\\t\\t\\tThere’s probably a reason ChatGPT is running on old data, and it’s because the process to update data is expensive & time-consuming.\\n\\t\\t\\tProcess for Updating\\n\\t\\t\\tAt a scheduled interval, we’ll go out and run various scripts to update data from various sources.\\n\\t\\t\\tIdeally, we would be able to pull the data that changed or was added since the last index update. Right now, the notion reader we are using does NOT have that information. This means we might have to custom-roll a process so that we can update the vector database.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe would update the delta of changes in the database. Data would need to have an embedding created and be saved to a document in a specific vector database.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe’ll probably need to batch changes as long processing time can sometimes cause errors. Additionally, what happens if we fubar the database? We’ll definitely need to come up with a recovery plan if something happens during the overnight jobs.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe would need to investigate if we need to take the tool down at a given interval for this type of maintenance.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe assumption here is the process can be done programmatically. Ideally, everything should be done via a script (or multiple scripts). If we are creating a process that requires the data to be loaded manually, then we should sit down and think of alternatives, like web scraping. We should set the expectation that if something is manual, we’d have to add another tool for someone to go in and update documents \\n\\t\\t\\tOR\\n\\t\\t\\t someone would need to be trained on the process and do that regularly.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe could also think about running this in the pipeline, but if we are updating a lot of things that could get expensive.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tWhat does the community do if we know the answer is wrong? \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGenerally, the biggest way we deal with wrong answers is:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProvide more data for embedding around the topic it is having issues with.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBetter prompt engineering. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHaving the AI cite its sources. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTest different settings for things like temperature and TopK. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAcceptance that LLMs will be wrong.\\n\\t\\t\\tHow do we update the vectors in the vector database?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPlease see the following article: \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUpdating the Vector Database\\n\\t\\t\\tWhat are the best practices to feed this info back?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUsually, we are going to want to look at the feedback and devise what data is bad and where we might need to update or remove an embedding. Sometimes it could be the specific data we embedded is bad. The LLM could also need more context which means more quality data is required.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFeeding back responses gets into fine-tuning which we want to avoid. We could record responses and if we have a cluster of data around a certain topic we can investigate. We could also take the response that has negative feedback and try to run it through the model again with different prompts to see if the LLM provides a better response. We can ask the user for more context at this point to improve the response too.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThere is a bit of danger with feeding back responses to the embeddings themselves since what is a good response versus a bad response is quite subjective. We should probably take time to review feedback first before we do something like this.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWe could also consider gathering feedback and see if we want to create new embeddings from this. Quality of response will matter. We would probably need to embed the conversation and tell the LLM if it is good or bad. Here’s a \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgood discussion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t I found on the topic.\\n\\t\\t\\thttps://towardsdatascience.com/llm-hallucinations-ec831dcd7786\\n\\t\\t\\t has some good methods for dealing with hallucinations.\\n\\t\\t\\thttps://txt.cohere.com/llm-parameters-best-outputs-language-ai/\\n\\t\\t\\t has information about parameters fed to the model.\\n\\t\\t\\tProviding More Data\\n\\t\\t\\tIf the model is answering things wrong after embedding new data, then there is a good chance that it needs more data to answer the question properly. Reinforcing what it already learned with new content will help.\\n\\t\\t\\tInformation fed to the model could have the following issues which would create problems:\\n\\t\\t\\tPoorly formed/captured content.\\n\\t\\t\\tIncomplete thoughts or ideas. LLMs generally like full and detailed sentences to get context.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe data needs to be cleaned better.\\n\\t\\t\\tDifferent Types of Prompt Engineering\\n\\t\\t\\tChain of Thought:\\n\\t\\t\\t Breaking down a problem with intermediate reasoning steps. \\n\\t\\t\\tHere are some examples\\n\\t\\t\\t of chain-of-thought reasoning. ReAct is a type of CoT model.\\n\\t\\t\\tTree of Thought: \\n\\t\\t\\tGives the model an opportunity to explore multiple branches of reasoning while self-evaluating as it progresses. This is taking chain-of-thought to a new level. \\n\\t\\t\\tThis repo has some examples\\n\\t\\t\\t of ToT and deeper explanations.\\n\\t\\t\\tSociety of Mind: \\n\\t\\t\\tThis is a brand new method of prompt engineering where we take answers from a couple of different models and then allow a model to improve its response using the previous answers from other LLMs as input. It allows the model to reason out a response. You can find more about that \\n\\t\\t\\there\\n\\t\\t\\t. This approach could be more expensive to run since more than one model is needed.\\n\\t\\t\\tFew-Shot Prompting: \\n\\t\\t\\tThe user provides a few examples of the task that the large language model should perform as well as a description of the task.\\n\\t\\t\\tInstructor-Based Prompting: \\n\\t\\t\\tInstructor-based prompting is based on instructing the large language model to act as a specific person while performing the desired task.\\n\\t\\t\\tHaving the AI cite its sources\\n\\t\\t\\tThe community as a whole knows that sometimes AI doesn’t provide correct answers. Allowing the AI to cite its sources with a metadata link to where the information came from allows users to cross-check sources with the answer the AI provided.\\n\\t\\t\\tTest different settings for things like temperature and TopK \\n\\t\\t\\tTemperature\\n\\t\\t\\t allows for more creativity in an AI response. Since we don’t want it to be TOO creative, we should limit how high we go with this value.\\n\\t\\t\\tTopK\\n\\t\\t\\t tells the model to pick the next token from the top ‘k’ tokens in its list, sorted by probability. This is how the model manages probability for creating a response.\\n\\t\\t\\tTopP \\n\\t\\t\\tis similar but picks from the top tokens based on the sum of their probabilities.\\n\\t\\t\\tLimiting the number of Tokens\\n\\t\\t\\t can also help so the probability of having the model return a better answer is higher.\\n\\t\\t\\tAcceptance that LLMs will be wrong\\n\\t\\t\\tSetting an expectation and providing sources with this is important to convey. Even the best LLM when given the same prompt over and over might create unexpected results.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe can ask the LLM to say they don’t know if the response does not have a high enough probability for an answer. We can then ask the user for more context.\\n\\t\\tGeneral Terms & Questions\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tLLM\\n\\t\\t - Large Language Model. A model is trained on huge amounts of data so it can understand and process language. There are various models that exist, the big one we’ve heard about is openAI (ChatGPT runs on this model).\\n\\t\\tFine-tuning\\n\\t\\t - customizing a model for a specific application. \\n\\t\\tHere is a good reference\\n\\t\\t.

You will have to prepare training data and then the model will internalize this new information. \\n\\t\\tEmbedding, you are adding context to your prompt. This means that you’ll need to store connections in a database, but will keep your information out of a model. \\n\\t\\thttps://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings\\n\\t\\tWe are currently using the embedding approach. \\n\\n\\t\\tFinetuning vs Semantic Search\\n\\n\\t\\tSource: David Shapiro: \\n\\t\\thttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qq6HTr7Ocw\\n\\n\\t\\tData Ingestion\\n\\t\\tWhat is a token?

The goal is for the model to generalize to new unseen examples in the same categories both quickly and effectively.\\n\\t\\tIn traditional\\xa0\\n\\t\\tzero-shot learning\\n\\t\\t, a classifier is trained on one set of labels and evaluated on a different set of labels that it has never seen before (thus, “zero-shot”). This typically requires providing the model with some type of metadata about the unseen categories in order for it to generalize. (This is the scenario addressed by our\\xa0\\n\\t\\tmeta-learning report\\n\\t\\t, in the context of image classification.) A variation on zero-shot learning is for the model to be evaluated both on never-before-seen and previously-seen labels; this is a more challenging task, because the model must recognize the difference.\\n\\t\\tQuote from \\n\\t\\thttps://few-shot-text-classification.fastforwardlabs.com/\\n\\n\\t\\tChatbots\\n\\t\\tPrompt Engineering / Prompt Templating\\n\\t\\t - Wrapping a user’s questions in a bigger prompt. For instance, take the question “Describe the Chicago Office?” and then wrap it with a prompt: “As a Focused Labs employee, please answer the following in 500 words or less: <Question>” which would be what is ultimately sent to the LLM for an answer. \\n\\t\\tThis can be even more useful if you want the chatbot to have a particular persona. By asking it to assume the persona you want when answering questions, it can affect the quality of answers returned.\\n\\t\\tQuerying top x results/similarity top k \\n\\t\\t- When you do a query against the indexed data, you can ask it to return a certain amount of documents that are relevant and summarize against that.\\n\\t\\tRetrieval Chain \\n\\t\\t- This is a langchain specific term.

It is a flexible practice that can be adjusted to current conditions, and is also a skill that can be improved with practice. It can improve quality of life as a dev, build teams, and make for better code.\\'\\n\\t\\t\\tWhat are pair retros? \\n\\t\\t\\t\\xa0Score: 5\\n\\t\\t\\t\"\\\\nPair retros are short retrospectives usually around 5 minutes held at the end of the day with the person you\\'ve been pairing with. The purpose is to talk about how the day went, reflect on what went well, and determine if there are ways the pair can collaborate better in the future. It\\'s a good opportunity to get to know your teammates working style and improve your future pairing sessions.\"\\n\\t\\t\\tTell me about the Chicago office, what is it like? \\n\\t\\t\\t\\xa0Score: 5\\n\\t\\t\\t\\'\\\\nThe Chicago office is located in the old post office building on the 11th floor, Suite B. It is accessible via CTA, Metra, bike, and automobile. The building requires an access badge to be carried at all times. There is a gym located on the second floor called Boxcar and the company will reimburse the cost of an annual membership. Lunch is provided on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and snacks, coffee, and other beverages are available throughout the day. There is a tenant portal and a Rise app to register visitors, find information about building events, and submit building forms. Incoming packages and mail should be shipped to the dock and the buildings messenger team will deliver it to the suite. Outgoing mail can be dropped off at the messenger center.\\'\\n\\t\\t\\tWhat is the 2023 strategy? \\n\\t\\t\\t\\xa0Score: 4.5\\n\\t\\t\\t\\'\\\\nThe 2023 strategy is to create a strong association of Focused Labs thought leadership with the Focused Labs logo, equip the sales team with a stronger narrative for closing deals, and attract top talent. Additionally, the vision is to create habitual behavior in publishing content that expresses all the amazing things that Focused Labs is already doing, targeting two distinct but not mutually exclusive audiences (buyers and practitioners).\\'\\n\\t\\t\\tWhy are we building the AI Enterprise Knowledge Hub? \\n\\t\\t\\t\\xa0Score: 5\\n\\t\\t\\t\\'\\\\nWe are building the AI Enterprise Knowledge Hub to reduce the presence of the lone SME or bus count of 1, reduce duplicate efforts, reduce the time it takes to bring new products to market, build and deliver more modern products and experiences, and reduce onboarding time for new developers. The AI Enterprise Knowledge Hub will aggregate internal company information, paired with data available publicly, to provide faster access to information and thus faster development times.\\'\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tWe took a small subset of the pages in notion.

Manufacturing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFocused on Delivery: Replaced legacy manual spreadsheet process with software that was scalable for BTR Energy and clients. Software manages and records charging events for over 100,000 electric vehicles (EV), while also automating reporting to a California regulator and to BTR Energy’s clients. Built and deployed a client-facing application for streamlining onboarding with BTR Energy’s Bridge platform and the management of EV charging data.\\nFocused on Results: Software propelled BTR Energy’s evolution from a software-enabled services company to a software-first product company for EV manufacturers and others.\\nFocused on Partnership: Focused Labs was trusted to serve as the technology arm of BTR Energy and has helped foster direct client relationships to build business-critical software. Developers at Focused Labs have become an integral part of BTR Energy’s success and growth over the last year.\\nAgile workflow enabled startup BTR Energy to automate workflows\\nBTR Energy launched in 2019 to provide a platform that automates participation in low carbon fuels programs, like California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS). BTR Energy’s platform connects EV manufacturers, fleet operators, and charging station networks to renewable electricity producers in order to generate LCFS “credits”. Together, BTR Energy and its clients use charging data from EVs to make quarterly submissions to the California Air Resources Board and to generate LCFS credits. These credits can be sold, generating revenue for BTR Energy and its clients. BTR Energy keeps a small percentage of this revenue, providing the majority to the EV manufacturers, fleet operators, or charging station networks, and the renewable electricity producers.\\nInitially, BTR Energy managed all of its data in spreadsheets, but its platform now collects near real-time EV charging data and automatically processes that data and creates the reports necessary to generate LCFS credits, making it possible to manage a much larger amount of data from more and more diverse clients.\\nThe engagement between BTR Energy and Focused Labs started in early 2020. Focused Labs started by automating small parts of the manual spreadsheet based solution BTR Energy was using. BTR Energy understood that this legacy system would not be scalable and would not be able to meet the needs of its clients. As such, Focused Labs set out to build a better way to manage the data, improving and automating and BTR Energy’s engagements with its clients.\\nOpportunity to evolve and grow BTR Energy’s capabilities\\nBTR Energy needed scalable ways to catalog, analyze and share large amounts of charging data between EV manufacturers and regulators, while also preserving consumer privacy and a high … of data protection. Spreadsheets could not serve the business, so Focused Labs built the BTR Energy “Bridge” platform, which includes direct integrations with its clients. This makes the transmission of EV charging data much more seamless for both BTR Energy and its clients.\\nBTR Bridge Platform\\n\\nCreated a React and Spring Boot-based application to:\\n\\nManage a fleet of over 100,000 electric vehicles (EVs)\\nRecord charging events for the EV fleet\\nGenerate quarterly registration and charging submissions for a California regulatory program, the Low Carbon Fuel Standard\\n\\n\\nCaptured over 8 million unique charging events from 4 different vehicle manufacturers.\\nImplemented a PostGIS-backed geo-filtering system that allows performant filtering of hundreds of thousands of charging events against 30,000 public charging stations in California.\\n\\nHaving an app to manage such a large amount of vehicle data and automating its delivery to the relevant regulator made it a valuable asset to both BTR Energy and their clients.\\nSince the development and deployment of the Bridge platform, BTR Energy has shifted from a software-enabled services business to a software-centric company.\\n\\n\\n“The software became the business,” says Jack Barrow, CEO of BTR Energy.\\n\\n\\nTrusting Focused Labs to meet directly with BTR Energy’s clients\\nOnce the BTR Bridge Platform was deployed, BTR Energy needed a technology-forward strategy with its clients. Barrow and his partners at BTR Energy trusted Focused Labs’ technology and people so much that they brought them to collaborative meetings with clients and prospects interested in integrating with BTR Energy’s software. At the time, BTR Energy did not have a full in-house technology team, so Focused Labs developers took on that role.\\nTrusting an outside company to meet with your clients (especially when the potential client pool is relatively small) is not a role Focused Labs took lightly. “We were looking for technical talent, but also people with the ability to maintain a relationship — and we absolutely got that from Focused Labs,” Barrow says. “We took [Focused Labs co-founders] Austin and Luke to Michigan to meet with one of our largest clients, and they just hit it off with everyone. I think it was helpful for BTR Energy’s credibility.”\\nBTR Energy’s trust in Focused Labs continues. Two developers from Focused Labs directly work with BTR Energy’s client tech teams to address and manage business needs as they arrive. In addition to fielding the needs of client tech teams, a core responsibility of the Focused Labs team has been the constant improvement of BTR Energy’s security posture. For each integration, a robust security review is conducted by BTR Energy’s clients. BTR Energy trusts Focused Labs to field these reviews and strengthen their security with each subsequent one; BTR Energy is now compliant with hundreds of specific security requirements imposed on it by its clients.\\nFinally, BTR Energy relied on the Focused Labs team to demonstrate the software’s capabilities to investors during a funding round in August 2021. This demonstration ultimately helped BTR secure those funds and advance the company forward.\\n\\n\\n“Client and investor presentations are important moments for an early-stage company like BTR Energy. Just as Austin and Luke had made a positive impression on our clients in 2020, Focused Labs engineers made a positive impression on investors in 2021. Enthusiasm for BTR Energy noticeably grew after the presentations, and both investors that met the Focused Labs team ultimately participated in BTR Energy’ Series A, a testament, in part, to the quality of the software and the presentations.”\\n\\n\\nBuilding a client-facing app for enhanced experience\\nInitially, the Bridge platform primarily supported work within BTR Energy — it was more functional than pretty. Once the business grew to work with automakers and their APIs, a client-facing friendly dashboard needed to be built. Focused Labs and BTR Energy collaborated to make and deploy a version of the Bridge platform for its clients.\\nThe Bridge For Clients\\nFocused Labs developers and BTR Energy worked together to:\\n\\nBuild a standardized REST API to allow BTR Energy to scale and onboard new clients faster (3 new clients since Summer 2020).\\nIterated on client platform in Spring 2021 to allow BTR to onboard client with new types of electric equipment (charging stations).\\nBuild and deploy a client-facing dashboard between March and June 2021 to allow clients new visibility into their charging data and the resulting LCFS credits.\\nConducted a thorough demo to potential investors in August 2021 to demonstrate the software’s capabilities during a funding round.\\nPlanned and executed a deployment infrastructure migration to improve BTR Energy’s security posture and technological independence in October 2021\\n\\nMaking integrations as easy as possible from the client side is paramount to BTR Energy’s business plan. The easier it is for an automaker or other clients to directly onboard with BTR Energy’s applications, the smoother the business relationship will be.\\nThe culture of Focused Labs will be the future of BTR Energy software\\nBTR Energy has grown significantly during its engagement with Focused Labs. As BTR Energy adapted to client needs, Focused Labs has been there to provide the technology and expertise needed for growth within tight timeframes. Eventually, BTR Energy will hire its own internal software development team, but the standards for building business changing software and doing so quickly will stand as the minimum. Focused Labs’ core practices of pair programming, CI/CD, and test-driven development have laid a foundation that future BTR Energy developers can build on in the years to come.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n433

Developed software to build a last-mile delivery market.\\nFocused on Results: In the first 3 months of using the mobile app, the recovery of numerous stolen vehicles saved the company hundreds of thousands in inventory. The last-mile delivery app contributed to Hertz’s bottom-line increase in revenue.\\nFocused on Partnership: Focused Labs built and deployed numerous applications with quick turnaround times — showing the developers at Hertz that technology solutions can be fast, functional, and profitable. Focused Labs took a very enablement-centric approach during the development process. Although Hertz had a very capable engineering team, they relied on Focused Labs to bring new, impactful, and sustainable engineering practices into their organization.\\nHelping Hertz Leverage Technology To Capture New Markets\\nDiversifying lines of business is one of the best ways to leverage technology within a company. More and more, technology and outside forces are shaping industries in new, quick ways that can make age-old businesses feel like they are in a constant state of flux. For instance, car rental giant Hertz and similar companies were upended as the pandemic shut down almost all global travel and put the need to rent cars at a standstill. Technology has helped Hertz rebound and opens up new lines of business while also finding solutions to old problems. But they didn’t always have the technology infrastructure to respond proactively to these issues.\\nHertz hired Opal Perry as Global CIO — to rebuild a technology-forward culture that would see digital solutions as a way to grow new business and not just a functional necessity.\\nIn the past, Hertz had outsourced a lot of its technology needs to external vendors. While it was functional for the ways technology had previously served Hertz, using outside vendors left their technology arm with a lack of innovation. An agile technology team within a business can know the pain points and work to fix them swiftly. Putting the innovation needs of a business into a third party is hard if you want to move quickly.\\nPerry needed to build up a technology team at Hertz that could be proactive in finding new solutions to their fast-paced business problems.\\nThat’s why she hired Focused Labs.\\nNavigating a culture and technology transformation\\nFocused Labs’ work with Hertz started in January of 2020. The company had been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic that globally put all travel to a standstill. Hertz needed to build technological solutions to pivot their business to encompass new ventures that could live outside of the usual model of renting cars direct to consumers.\\nTo do that, Hertz also needed to change the development culture. This transformation could leverage technology to discover new lines of business or improve older ways of working.\\n“We wanted fast help to get the work done,” says Perry, “but also to embed the culture and ways of working that we want to be our target state.”\\nTwo Focused Labs developers paired with two members of the Hertz RevLab team to get to work. By working directly alongside team members of Hertz, they were able to learn the kinds of methods and curiosity Focused Labs keeps top of mind when developing a new piece of software.\\nBuilding a more durable business with technology solutions\\nWork between Focused Labs developers and the Hertz RevLab in Bannockburn, IL started with finding out what business opportunities currently exist and could exist in the future. They were looking for ways that technology could pivot to new business lines and software to support that business line could be built and deployed. The quicker a business can adjust to a market in flux, the more durable that business can become in the long term.\\nSVU: Stolen Vehicles Unit\\nThe initial engagement between Hertz and Focused Labs started with a discovery process to identify areas in which Hertz may be underutilizing their existing vehicles. Through this process, they found that substantial time was being lost within the organization due to vehicle theft. It was time-consuming to identify a vehicle had been stolen and the longer the vehicle went undetected as stolen, the less likely it was to be returned.\\nHertz RevLab and Focused Labs embarked on a project called SVU (stolen vehicles unit). The teams built and deployed a mobile application that allows the Hertz recovery team to detect, track and recover stolen vehicles. So far it has been wildly successful. In the first 3 months of use, numerous stolen Hertz vehicles were recovered — which saved the company hundreds of thousands of dollars in inventory.\\nWorking with stakeholders inside Hertz, including the executive team, helped Focused Labs to scope, shape, and prioritize the way software was ideated, built, and deployed into use.\\nTNC: Transportation Network Company\\nOne of the business lines outside of Hertz\\'s standard consumer rentals is TNC — a program that rents vehicles to Uber and Lyft rideshare drivers. Often someone will decide against buying another vehicle or using their own in favor of renting a vehicle to drive customers where they need to go. Uber and Lyft are both technology-forward companies with everything necessary to their business living within an app on the driver and rider’s phones. Hertz needed a similarly easy-to-use portal for TNC partners to access all of the necessary compliance documents that come with standard rideshare agreements.\\nBeing able to adjust to the needs of fast-paced markets like ridesharing is a big benefit to doing this work in an agile way. “We’re no more than a week away from making a change in the iteration planning process. We’ve gained speed-to-market and agility,” says Brandon Mendoza, VP of Hertz’s Transportation Network Company. “Now we’re never a week away from making a material change to our strategy.”\\n\\n\\n“We’re no more than a week away from making a change in the iteration planning process. We’ve gained speed-to-market and agility,” says Brandon Mendoza, VP of Hertz’s Transportation Network Company.\\n\\n\\nGaining new revenue streams for Hertz with last-mile delivery\\nAs the pandemic cut down on vehicle rentals, Hertz had to develop new ways to use the existing fleets of vehicles and staff still on hand. There was an opportunity in the fact that delivery services were booming as so many people were no longer doing their shopping in person.\\nMaking tens of thousands of software-enabled deliveries within retail shipping\\nIn less than 3 weeks, Focused Labs and Hertz developers built an initial dispatching system to fulfill a new market for Hertz — last-mile delivery. A retail partner hired Hertz to finish off deliveries they needed to reach their customers. This opened the door for Focused Labs to help develop that software.\\nFrom July - November 2020:\\n\\nThe dispatching system was iterated and improved upon\\nFocused Labs built a mobile application to support both delivery drivers and deliver customers package insights\\nFocused Labs built an invoicing system so Hertz could automate billing their retail partners using this new service.\\n\\nThese pieces of software-enabled Hertz to provide the retailer with the capability to reach a broader customer delivery base. Hertz generated revenue that would not have been able to happen without quick technology solutions.\\nIncreased revenue captured via logistics\\nHertz leveraged its logistics partnerships to fulfill last-mile deliveries. Focused Labs helped lead the team in building the software to make this highly profitable venture feasible.\\nIn a short time-frame Hertz and Focused Labs:\\n\\nBuilt and deployed a React Native mobile application to the Google Play store in 2 weeks.\\nBuilt a backend API and integration with a partner to enable delivery manifests to automatically deploy to the app.\\nProvided support for partner last-mile deliveries.\\n\\nThis extremely quick app deployment helped Hertz and its partner realize a material increase in package deliveries and generated a new stream of revenue. These quick turnarounds for such large deliverables proved out the methods of Focused Labs.\\nChanging the future of Hertz technology\\nThe deliverables in these quickly turned around projects is undeniable, which is why the partnership between Focused Labs and Hertz is still going. The number of Focused Labs developers engaged has increased to ten, to cover more ground in building and embedding culture. Thanks to Focused Labs’ enablement approach, Hertz is steadily evolving its technology culture to be a place where the kind of agile developers who can deliver the best technology will want to work.\\nIn hiring Focused Labs, Hertz not only gained agility and flexibility but also learned new engineering practices. Focused Labs helped show Hertz developers the kind of autonomy and confidence needed to build the right piece of software for right now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\nPlease leave your contact information for more details about your project\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n

development was the direction they wanted to pursue. When a few software development contractors decided not to renew their work before finishing a project for Aperture’s client, Troy Anderson, chief production and information officer, saw an opportunity to partner with Focused Labs. He wanted to both finish a project in a time crunch and extend the working relationships to guide his team toward a more agile way of developing software.\\nAperture Health delivers provider management software for companies all across the healthcare space. Anderson’s goal in working with Focused Labs was to enhance his team’s ability to build and deploy complex, specific and impressive software to their clients.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFocused on Delivery\\n\\nFocused Labs developers accelerated product delivery for one of Aperture’s largest clients.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFocused on Results\\n\\nFocused Labs quickly saved a time-sensitive project abandoned by previous development contractors.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFocused on Partnership\\n\\nAperture partnered with Focused Labs to imbue agile work states within their engineering teams.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFocused on Delivery: Focused Labs developers accelerated product delivery for one of Aperture’s largest clients, while building a primary source verification (PSV) API to enable verification and credentialing. During these projects, Focused Labs enabled Aperture’s team with the benefits of Extreme Programming.\\nFocused on Results: Quickly saved a time-sensitive project abandoned by previous development contractors. The PSV API made verification possible within hours instead of weeks. Aperture’s engineers have embraced more pair programming work and significantly improved the daily working relationships between Aperture and client stakeholders.\\nFocused on Partnership: Aperture partnered with Focused Labs to imbue agile work states within their engineering teams while also quickly building software for a client. This will give Aperture a more agile approach to building and deploying valuable software going forward.\\nGuiding an agile Transformation for Aperture’s Development Team\\nAperture Health wanted to work smarter — an agile transformation in product and software development was the direction they wanted to pursue. When a few software development contractors decided not to renew their work before finishing a project for Aperture’s client, Troy Anderson, chief production and information officer, saw an opportunity to partner with Focused Labs. He wanted to both finish a project in a time crunch and extend the working relationships to guide his team toward a more agile way of developing software.\\nAperture Health delivers provider management software for companies all across the healthcare space. Anderson’s goal in working with Focused Labs was to enhance his team’s ability to build and deploy complex, specific and impressive software to their clients.\\nBuilding time-saving healthcare API’s ahead of schedule\\nThe first development project between Aperture and Focused Labs started in December of 2020. The previous team of developers had ended their contract before finishing the job, so understanding the work and its context was the biggest issue in getting started.\\nThe project needed to be finished quickly and Focused Labs was up for the challenge. “Having partners who can quickly staff up like Focused is nice to have,” says Will Reed, former head of engineering at Aperture. “They basically hopped onto a speeding train from a standstill.”\\nAperture needed Focused Labs to help build out a primary source verification (PSV) API for a client. PSV is the method a healthcare provider uses to verify someone has the right certificate, license or registration to practice a profession. This important piece of Aperture client’s work was taking weeks to accomplish due to lack of automation in sharing that data.\\nFocused Labs quickly built a self-service API that enabled Aperture’s client to accomplish PSV within hours —not days. By automating the data retrieval process between accreditor and provider, this software cut PSV requests — which could manually take more than three days — down to four hours. They further streamlined the process by then developing automated billing and invoicing for the API clients.\\nAnd they delivered it all three weeks ahead of schedule.\\nProving the benefits of an agile transformation through pair programming\\nDuring this project, Focused Labs’ developers worked alongside Aperture’s to show the benefits of pair programming. Aperture wanted to move away from a waterfall type workflow to more iterative development. Focused Labs showed Aperture’s team the benefits of things like weekly team rituals and a cadenced release schedule for a project in progress.\\nFocused Labs also collaborated with Aperture to bring more modern tooling into their work environment. When partnering with development teams, Focused Labs always looks to implement new modern systems. With Aperture, the legacy applications they were previously working with made it virtually impossible to find out when the software Aperture was providing to its clients was faltering. To close that feedback loop between Aperture’s clients and Aperture, Focused Labs suggested and then implemented new tooling — such as New Relic — to facilitate performance monitoring. This way the client did not need to alert developers when things were breaking — they now had the tools to monitor performance themselves.\\nThrough working in a more collaborative, agile process, Aperture was able to solve problems in smaller chunks which led to a greater end result. Focused Labs also worked directly with Aperture’s client development team to mend the communication and relationship that had been strained by the contractors who left the project unfinished. This direct communication and collaboration has led to significant improvement in workflow and understanding between Aperture and their client stakeholders.\\nMaking an agile transition away from top-down workflow\\nAperture could have used any other development partner, but what was appealing about Focused Labs was the culture and workflow they were able to model with Aperture’s team.\\n\\n\\nFocused Labs are educators and modelers of new behaviors and new practices.\\nOur team brought the knowledge of the tech stack and Focused Labs were bringing tools in terms of how to work and how to gain confidence about the software that is being built. Everyone’s adding value from day one,” says Reed. “Focused Labs are transferring their process to us and their job is to get out of here.”\\n\\n\\nFocused Labs embodied the best ways to produce valuable software to Aperture’s clients and worked alongside them to ensure they knew it was possible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\nPlease

Systems\\n\\n\\nIndustry\\nWellness\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Focused Labs is hands down the best in the business. From their top notch team to seamless process, they helped to optimize our business backend operations and web experience for our clients. Before working with Focused Labs, we managed many of our systems manually, taking valuable human capital away from our customers. Now our systems are automated, allowing us to put our focus back on our customers. I couldn\\'t recommend anyone more highly than the Focused Labs team.”\\nCaitlyn Fagan, Chief Operating Officer at Inner Matrix Systems\\n\\n\\nAbout\\nInner Matrix System (IMS) is a personal development company that aims to help clients create a meaningful and fulfilling life. Founded by Joey Klein, the program engages clients with guided meditations, 1:1 training, and weekend events.\\nProblem Space\\nEven before the pandemic, IMS had been looking to modernize their digital experiences, which were outdated and not user friendly. Users wanted an easier experience when registering for events, accessing digital materials and viewing upcoming programs and events. The business wanted to create a more professional digital presence, update their programming platform, and scale offerings. With the onset of COVID, it was the perfect opportunity, and business critical, to improve their technology.\\nSolution\\nUsing an iterative approach, the Focused Labs team built and modernized IMS’s new digital presence in phases, which included website rebuilds, a mobile app, updated backend services, and content migration.\\nPhase I\\n\\nRebuild the existing Inner Matrix Group (IMG) and Inner Matrix System (IMS) websites. Automate registration for events and programs to reduce admin hours spent manually registering members. Create a self-registration flow for members, and a trainer portal for trainers and apprentices to manage courses and payments.\\n\\nPhase II\\n\\nMigrate digital and audio visual content from Wordpress to EKS with a Vue and Rails backend to provide greater flexibility in how content can be accessed. Deprecate legacy systems.\\n\\nPhase III\\n\\nCreate a mobile app that allows community members to engage with IMS content offline and on the go. Build a membership registration flow that provides unique access and pricing to IMS content and programs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was easy to navigate! Loved the FAQ section with the dropdown boxes. Everything was very clear and easy to understand! Thank you for all the effort to make this a wonderful tool for changing lives.\"\\nIMS Customer\\n\\n\\nApproach\\nOur team at Focused started each phase of work with a scoping session, to map out and understand what we were building. Then, we built out a backlog to sustain the team for a few weeks and got to work. On Mondays, we kicked off the week with an iterative planning meeting. In this hour, we talked about immediate priorities, asked questions about business processes that impacted features, and discussed any challenges. Other weekly rituals for the team included morning standups and a weekly retro.\\nDuring each phase, we partnered closely with the IMS team and subject matter experts. We mapped out process flows, interviewed users, and highlighted business requirements, to ensure that we were building the right thing.\\n\\nResults\\nWith updated and more automated tools, the IMS team has seen a reduction in customer complaints and help calls. Their customers and trainers are thrilled with the updates. Moreover, administrators now have more insight and control into setting up and managing events and products, which lets them react faster to customer needs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\nPlease leave your contact information for more details about your project\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Get in touch with us\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n433 W Van Buren St\\nSuite 1100-B\\nChicago, IL 60607\\n(708) 303-8088\\n\\n\\n\\nwork@focusedlabs.io\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nHome\\nAbout\\nServices\\nContact Us\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEXPLORE\\n\\nCase Studies\\nBlog\\nCareers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2022 Focused Labs, All Rights Reserved.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nvar hsVars = hsVars || {}; hsVars[\\'language\\'] = \\'en\\';\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        var options = {\\n            portalId: \\'5845897\\',\\n            formId: \\'4a2f1fab-24b7-4829-8563-e147046be648\\',\\n            formInstanceId: \\'5652\\',\\n            pageId: \\'94291621513\\',\\n            region: \\'na1\\',\\n            \\n            \\n            \\n            \\n            pageName: \"Focused Labs\",\\n            \\n            \\n            \\n            inlineMessage: \"Thanks for submitting the form.\",\\n            \\n            \\n            rawInlineMessage: \"Thanks for submitting the form.\",\\n            \\n            \\n            hsFormKey: \"4cd77efa5538b0972b71d7b8bfd63065\",\\n            \\n            \\n            css: \\'\\',\\n            target: \\'#hs_form_target_form_624917906\\',\\n            \\n            \\n            \\n            \\n            \\n            contentType: \"standard-page\",\\n            \\n            \\n            \\n            formsBaseUrl: \\'/_hcms/forms/\\',\\n            \\n            \\n            \\n            formData: {\\n                cssClass: \\'hs-form stacked hs-custom-form\\'\\n            }\\n        };\\n\\n        options.getExtraMetaDataBeforeSubmit = function() {\\n            var metadata = {};\\n            \\n\\n            if (hbspt.targetedContentMetadata) {\\n                var count = hbspt.targetedContentMetadata.length;\\n                var targetedContentData = [];\\n                for (var i = 0; i < count; i++) {\\n                    var tc = hbspt.targetedContentMetadata[i];\\n                     if ( tc.length !== 3) {\\n                        continue;\\n                     }\\n                     targetedContentData.push({\\n                        definitionId: tc[0],\\n                        criterionId: tc[1],\\n                        smartTypeId: tc[2]\\n                     });\\n                }\\n                metadata[\"targetedContentMetadata\"] = JSON.stringify(targetedContentData);\\n            }\\n\\n            return metadata;\\n        };\\n\\n        hbspt.forms.create(options);\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nvar _hsq = _hsq || [];\\n_hsq.push([\"setContentType\", \"standard-page\"]);\\n_hsq.push([\"setCanonicalUrl\", \"https:\\\\/\\\\/focusedlabs.io\\\\/case-studies\\\\/automated-core-business-functionality\"]);\\n_hsq.push([\"setPageId\", \"94291621513\"]);\\n_hsq.push([\"setContentMetadata\", {\\n    \"contentPageId\": 94291621513,\\n    \"legacyPageId\": \"94291621513\",\\n    \"contentFolderId\": null,\\n    \"contentGroupId\": null,\\n    \"abTestId\": null,\\n    \"languageVariantId\": 94291621513,\\n    \"languageCode\": \"en\",\\n    \\n}]);\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nvar hsVars = {\\n    render_id: \"03aaf0a8-9e0e-4eaf-b2c7-bcfba46cf4b0\",\\n    ticks: 1687113171927,\\n    page_id: 94291621513,\\n    \\n    content_group_id: 0,\\n    portal_id: 5845897,\\n    app_hs_base_url: \"https://app.hubspot.com\",\\n    cp_hs_base_url: \"https://cp.hubspot.com\",\\n    language: \"en\",\\n    analytics_page_type: \"standard-page\",\\n    analytics_page_id: \"94291621513\",\\n    category_id: 1,\\n    folder_id: 0,\\n    is_hubspot_user: false\\n}\\n\\n\\n', doc_id='07a6cf65-c514-4938-b636-f1d00f1395d3', embedding=None, doc_hash='dcaffca2a8744fba99085fba8ba716575f1172956f16a37d8fea5b11e41b2791', extra_info={'URL': 'https://focusedlabs.io/case-studies/automated-core-business-functionality'})]\n"
